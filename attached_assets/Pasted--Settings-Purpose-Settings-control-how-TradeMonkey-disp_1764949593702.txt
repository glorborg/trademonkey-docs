# Settings

## Purpose

Settings control how TradeMonkey displays your data, enforces optional workflows, and communicates with you. They do **not** change what data is collected or how analytics and rules actually work — they only change how everything is presented and when you’re nudged to review it.

There are two types of settings:

- **User settings** – your personal preferences.
- **Organization settings** – workspace-wide behavior (shared in multi-user setups).

## User Settings

### Profile

- **Name** – Used for greetings and reports. Optional.
- **Email** – Used for login and important notifications.  
  If you need to change your login email, contact support at **hello@trademonkey.app**.

### Timezone

- Used to show all times in your local time and to evaluate time-based rules (e.g. “no trading after X”).
- Affects:
  - How entry/exit times are displayed.
  - When “per day” limits reset.
  - When news events show up in the calendar.
- If you travel or relocate, update your timezone so rules and analytics line up with your actual session times.

### Preferred Currency

- Controls how P&L and risk are **displayed**.
- Does **not** change how raw trade data is stored or automatically convert between currencies.
- If you trade in multiple currencies and want everything in one currency, you may need to convert values before logging.

### Theme

- Switch between light and dark modes.
- Visual only; does not affect any data or analytics.

### Email Recaps

- Turn daily and/or weekly email summaries on or off.
- Recaps can include:
  - Trade counts and P&L summary.
  - High-level rule violations and basic behavioral patterns.
- Core analytics are always available in-app, even if you disable emails.

## Organization (Workspace) Settings

In a single-user setup, these effectively act as “global” personal settings. In multi-user workspaces, they apply to everyone in that workspace.

### Workspace Name

- Label shown in the UI and on exports/reports.
- Cosmetic only.

### Behavior Mode

Controls how “strict” and direct TradeMonkey feels in its messaging and prompts. It does **not** change the underlying data or rule checks.

- **Gentler modes** – Softer language, fewer interruptions, reflections mostly optional.
- **Stricter modes** – More direct language, more visible warnings, stronger encouragement to review trades and reflect.

Choose the mode that matches how much accountability vs friction you want.

### Reflection Requirement

- When **off**: reflections are optional; trades are considered complete as soon as they close.
- When **on**: trades are marked as “unreviewed” until you add at least one reflection.
- Helpful if you want enforced review; can feel heavy if you take many trades per day.

### Streaks and Nudges

- **Streaks** – Can show win/loss streaks by day. Purely informational; does not affect rules.
- **Nudge intensity** – Controls how often you see reminders and pattern alerts (e.g. repeated rule violations, strong conviction gaps, recurring emotions).
  - Lower intensity = fewer prompts, more self-directed review.
  - Higher intensity = more prompts and reminders, more visible alerts.

Adjust based on whether you want more awareness or fewer interruptions.

### Morning Prompts

- Choose where to receive pre-session prompts (in-app, email, or both).
- Prompts can summarize recent performance, rule violations, and key patterns before you start trading.

## AI Features and Limits

Some features (e.g. AI summaries, deep-dive analysis, rule coaching) use AI and may have **daily usage limits** that reset regularly.

- Limits can vary by feature and subscription level.
- When you hit a limit for a feature, you’ll see a clear in-app message and that feature will be temporarily unavailable until the next reset.
- Core journaling, rules, and analytics continue to work even if you’ve hit AI limits or choose not to use AI at all.

For current AI availability and limits, see the **pricing page**.

## Recommended Setup

When you first start:

1. Set your **timezone** and **preferred currency**.
2. Pick a **behavior mode** that fits your personality (most traders start with a balanced/standard mode).
3. Decide whether you want **email recaps** and adjust **nudge intensity** up or down after a week of use.
4. Consider enabling **reflection requirement** only if you want strict accountability and don’t take a large number of trades each day.

You can change any of these settings later as your workflow evolves.
