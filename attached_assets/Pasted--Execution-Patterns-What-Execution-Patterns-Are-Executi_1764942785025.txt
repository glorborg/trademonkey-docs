# Execution Patterns


## What Execution Patterns Are


Execution patterns are statistically meaningful recurring behaviors that appear across multiple dimensions of your trading data. Unlike single-trade observations or one-time events, patterns represent consistent tendencies that repeat under similar conditions.


A pattern combines:


- **Psychology**: Emotions, conviction scores, plan adherence
- **Compliance**: Rule violations and adherence rates
- **Outcomes**: P&L, win rate, risk-reward
- **Timing**: Time of day, session, day of week
- **Context**: Setup tags, account type, market conditions


Execution patterns answer: "What behaviors consistently repeat? Under what conditions? With what outcomes?"


Patterns are not rules. Rules are prescriptive statements you set ("Max 3 trades per day"). Patterns are descriptive observations TradeMonkey detects ("After losing first trade, you exceed daily trade limit 35% of the time").


## What Qualifies as a Pattern


Not every correlation is a pattern. TradeMonkey identifies patterns based on statistical thresholds and repetition criteria:


### Statistical Significance Requirements


**Minimum Occurrences**: Pattern must appear in at least 5 instances


**Example**:
- "FOMO entries lose money": Requires at least 5 FOMO-tagged trades
- "Afternoon conviction drops": Requires at least 5 afternoon trades with conviction drops


**Rationale**: Fewer than 5 instances may be noise, not signal.


**Correlation Strength**: Pattern must show meaningful difference from baseline


**Example**:
- FOMO trades: 22% win rate
- Non-FOMO trades: 58% win rate
- Difference: 36 percentage points (meaningful)


vs


- Morning trades: 54% win rate
- Afternoon trades: 52% win rate
- Difference: 2 percentage points (not meaningful, likely variance)


**Threshold**: Minimum 15% difference in win rate, or ±$50 difference in average P&L, or 20% difference in adherence


**Consistency**: Pattern must appear across multiple time periods


**Example**:
- Week 1: FOMO trades 20% win rate
- Week 2: FOMO trades 25% win rate
- Week 3: FOMO trades 18% win rate
- Pattern: Consistently low win rate (stable pattern)


vs


- Week 1: FOMO trades 20% win rate
- Week 2: FOMO trades 65% win rate
- Week 3: FOMO trades 15% win rate
- Not a pattern: High variance, inconsistent (likely small sample or changing conditions)


### Repetition Criteria


**Temporal Consistency**: Pattern appears across at least 2 distinct time periods (weeks, sessions, or trade batches)


**Conditional Consistency**: Pattern appears across multiple examples of the same condition


**Example**:
- Condition: "After 2+ consecutive losses"
- Instances: 8 times
- Pattern behavior: 7 out of 8 times, next trade violated "Max trades" rule
- Consistency: 87% (strong pattern)


**Multi-Dimensional Validation**: Pattern appears in related metrics, not just one


**Example**:
- Pattern: "Afternoon trades underperform"
- Evidence across dimensions:
  - Win rate: 38% afternoon vs 68% morning (30% gap)
  - Average P&L: -$34 afternoon vs +$118 morning ($152 gap)
  - Conviction scores: 5.2 afternoon vs 7.4 morning (2.2 point gap)
  - Plan adherence: 43% afternoon vs 76% morning (33% gap)
- Multi-dimensional validation: All metrics point to same pattern


**Example of non-pattern** (single dimension only):
- Afternoon trades: 52% win rate vs morning 58% (small gap)
- Afternoon P&L: +$85 vs morning +$92 (negligible)
- Afternoon conviction: 6.8 vs morning 6.9 (negligible)
- Only win rate shows minor difference, other metrics similar → Not a pattern

## How Patterns Are Detected


TradeMonkey uses multiple systems to surface execution patterns:


### 1. Psychology Tracking Analytics


**Detection Method**: Aggregates trades by emotion, conviction level, and adherence, then calculates performance metrics for each category.


**Patterns Detected**:
- **Emotional cost**: Which emotions correlate with losses?
- **Conviction gaps**: When does confidence collapse?
- **Adherence breakdown**: Where does discipline fail?


**Example Output**:
> "FOMO-tagged trades: 18 instances, 22% win rate, -$2,610 total cost. Pattern: FOMO emotion consistently correlates with poor outcomes."


**Data Used**: Emotions, conviction scores, plan adherence flags, P&L


### 2. Rules vs Reality Dashboard


**Detection Method**: Tracks rule violations over time, identifies clustering and contextual conditions.


**Patterns Detected**:
- **Violation clustering**: Do violations concentrate in specific conditions?
- **Chronic vs acute failures**: Is rule-breaking systemic or situational?
- **Conditional compliance**: Does adherence vary by time, emotion, or setup?


**Example Output**:
> "Max 3 trades/day violated 8 times. 7 out of 8 violations occurred after first trade was a loss. Pattern: Opening loss triggers overtrading."


**Data Used**: Rule evaluations, violation timestamps, trade outcomes, tags


### 3. Time-Scoped Analytics


**Detection Method**: Compares performance metrics across different time windows (morning vs afternoon, weekday vs weekend, recent vs historical).


**Patterns Detected**:
- **Session-based variance**: Do results differ by time of day?
- **Behavioral decay**: Is discipline eroding over time?
- **Day-of-week effects**: Does performance vary by day?


**Example Output**:
> "Morning trades (before 12 PM): 68% win rate, 76% adherence. Afternoon trades (after 2 PM): 38% win rate, 43% adherence. Pattern: Afternoon discipline collapse."


**Data Used**: Trade timestamps, performance metrics, adherence scores


### 4. AI Diagnostics


**Detection Method**: Scans all data dimensions using machine learning to identify correlations and multi-dimensional patterns human analysis might miss.


**Patterns Detected**:
- **Multi-factor patterns**: Combinations of conditions (e.g., afternoon + FOMO + after losses)
- **Hidden correlations**: Non-obvious relationships (e.g., conviction drops occur 22 minutes after entry)
- **Temporal patterns**: Sequences and cascades (e.g., violation triggers more violations)


**Example Output**:
> "Conviction drops by 4.2 points on losing trades vs 0.8 on winners. 83% of trades with conviction gap < -4 closed before stop or target. Pattern: Large conviction drops predict premature exits."


**Data Used**: All available structured data (emotions, conviction, adherence, outcomes, timing, tags)


### 5. AI Deep Dive Explorer


**Detection Method**: User-directed exploration to investigate specific patterns in depth through follow-up questions.


**Patterns Detected**:
- **Causal chains**: Why does pattern X occur?
- **Amplifying conditions**: What makes pattern X stronger?
- **Conditional variance**: Does pattern X differ under condition Y?


**Example Output**:
> **You**: "Why does my conviction drop during trades?"
> **AI**: "Conviction drops occur most frequently when trades go 15+ pips negative. 86% of conviction-drop trades had drawdowns exceeding 15 pips."


**Data Used**: Same as AI Diagnostics, but explored interactively based on user questions


### 6. Execution Recap


**Detection Method**: Visual review of multiple trades in sequence, allowing human pattern recognition through before/after screenshots and psychological data.


**Patterns Detected**:
- **Visual setup deterioration**: Do entry screenshots show weaker setups in certain conditions?
- **Emotional consistency**: Do certain emotions appear together frequently?
- **Exit behavior clusters**: Do premature exits concentrate in specific sessions?


**Example Output**:
> User observes: "8 out of last 10 afternoon trades show cluttered entry screenshots and low conviction scores, while morning trades show clean setups and high conviction. Visual pattern: Afternoon setup quality deteriorates."


**Data Used**: Screenshots, emotions, conviction, outcomes

## How Patterns Feed Into AI Features


Execution patterns are the raw material for TradeMonkey's AI features. Detected patterns enable AI to provide specific, data-driven insights.


### AI Diagnostics Uses Patterns


**Pattern Detection → Diagnostic Finding**


**Example 1**:
- **Pattern Detected**: FOMO entries have 22% win rate across 18 instances, $2,610 total cost
- **Diagnostic Finding**: "FOMO entry cost: -$2,610 this month. 18 instances, 22% win rate. Pattern: FOMO emotion consistently correlates with poor outcomes."


**Example 2**:
- **Pattern Detected**: Afternoon trades show 43% adherence vs 76% morning adherence across 52 trades
- **Diagnostic Finding**: "Afternoon discipline breakdown: 43% plan adherence vs 76% morning adherence. 18 afternoon trades, 45% win rate. Pattern: Afternoon trading shows lower adherence and worse performance."


**Without patterns**: AI Diagnostics would only report raw statistics ("52 trades this month"). With patterns, it surfaces significant correlations.


### AI Deep Dive Explorer Uses Patterns


**Pattern Detection → Exploration Starting Point**


**Example**:
- **Pattern Detected**: Conviction drops 4.2 points on losing trades
- **User Asks Deep Dive**: "Why does my conviction drop so much on losing trades?"
- **AI Explores Pattern**: Analyzes when conviction drops occur, what triggers them, which conditions amplify them


**Pattern provides context for exploration**: Without detected pattern, user wouldn't know what to explore. Pattern detection identifies which questions to ask.


### Time-Scoped Analytics Uses Patterns


**Pattern Detection → Temporal Comparison**


**Example**:
- **Pattern Detected**: Recent win rate (48%) is 10% lower than all-time (58%)
- **Time-Scoped Display**: "Last 30 Days: 48% win rate (↓ 10% from all-time 58%). Pattern: Recent performance decline."


**Pattern provides directionality**: Without pattern detection (comparing recent to all-time), Time-Scoped Analytics would just show current metrics without revealing trends.


### Rules vs Reality Dashboard Uses Patterns


**Pattern Detection → Violation Context**


**Example**:
- **Pattern Detected**: "Max trades/day" rule violated 8 times, 7 after opening loss
- **Dashboard Display**: "Violations: 8. Pattern: 87% of violations occur after first trade of day was a loss. Days starting with losses: 35% violation rate."


**Pattern provides actionable context**: Without pattern detection, dashboard would only show violation count. Pattern reveals when/why violations occur.


### Execution Recap Uses Patterns


**Pattern Detection → Visual Validation**


**Example**:
- **Pattern Detected**: 8 out of 10 afternoon trades have low conviction and poor outcomes
- **Recap Display**: Shows afternoon trades with screenshots side-by-side
- **User Validates Pattern**: Visually confirms afternoon entry screenshots show weaker setups


**Pattern guides visual review**: Without pattern detection, user might not notice afternoon trades cluster at bottom of performance list. Pattern detection highlights what to review visually.

## Clinical Pattern Examples


These examples show execution patterns using TradeMonkey's mirror language: descriptive, not prescriptive.


### Pattern 1: Afternoon Discipline Collapse


**Detected Across**:
- Psychology Tracking: Afternoon trades show entry conviction 5.2 avg vs morning 7.4 avg
- Rules Dashboard: Afternoon plan adherence 43% vs morning 76%
- Time-Scoped Analytics: Afternoon win rate 38% vs morning 68%
- Execution Recap: Visual confirmation of weaker entry setups in afternoon


**Pattern Statement (Clinical)**:
> "Trades entered after 2 PM show 38% plan adherence vs 76% before 2 PM. Afternoon trades: 18 total, 38% win rate, average P&L -$34, entry conviction 5.2. Morning trades: 34 total, 68% win rate, average P&L +$118, entry conviction 7.4. Conviction gap in afternoon: -3.1 avg vs -1.4 morning. Pattern: Afternoon trading shows lower conviction, lower adherence, and worse performance across all dimensions."


**What pattern reveals**: Time of day correlates with discipline and performance variance. Afternoon sessions exhibit multi-dimensional deterioration.


**What pattern does NOT say**: "Stop trading after 2 PM" or "You're tired in the afternoon" (coaching/interpretation).


### Pattern 2: Conviction Decay Predicts Premature Exits


**Detected Across**:
- Psychology Tracking: Conviction gap -4.2 avg on losing trades vs -0.8 on winners
- Trade Recap: 83% of trades with gap < -4 closed before stop or target
- Threads: Mid-trade notes show doubt appearing 15-30 min after entry on gap trades


**Pattern Statement (Clinical)**:
> "Your conviction drops 4.2 points from entry to exit on losing trades, 0.8 points on winners. Of 23 trades with conviction gap < -4, 19 (83%) closed before stop loss or take profit hit. Average exit: 8 pips before planned stop. Average P&L on premature exits: -$88 vs -$65 on trades held to stop. Pattern: Large conviction drops predict premature exits and slightly worse losses."


**What pattern reveals**: Conviction collapse during execution correlates with exits before planned levels.


**What pattern does NOT say**: "Trust your stops" or "Your emotions override your plan" (coaching/interpretation).


### Pattern 3: FOMO Emotional Cost


**Detected Across**:
- Psychology Tracking: FOMO emotion appears 18 times, 22% win rate, -$142 avg P&L
- Rules Dashboard: FOMO trades violate R:R rule 68% of time (vs 10% overall)
- Execution Recap: FOMO-tagged trades show entry after 20-40 pip moves (late entry)


**Pattern Statement (Clinical)**:
> "FOMO-tagged trades: 18 instances, 22% win rate (vs 58% overall), average P&L -$142 (vs +$85 overall). Total cost: -$2,556. FOMO trades averaged entry conviction 4.1 (vs 6.8 overall), R:R ratio 1.1:1 (vs 2.3:1 overall). Exit emotions: Regret (14 times), Frustration (11 times). Pattern: FOMO emotion correlates with low conviction entries, poor risk-reward, and consistently negative outcomes."


**What pattern reveals**: FOMO emotion is a reliable negative performance indicator across multiple metrics.


**What pattern does NOT say**: "Avoid FOMO trades" or "Control your impulses" (coaching/advice).


### Pattern 4: Post-Loss Overtrading


**Detected Across**:
- Rules Dashboard: "Max 3 trades/day" violated 8 times, 7 after opening loss
- Time-Scoped Analytics: Days starting with losses average 4.2 trades (vs 2.8 on winning days)
- Psychology Tracking: Trades after losses show "Revenge" emotion 28% of time (vs 8% overall)


**Pattern Statement (Clinical)**:
> "Days starting with a losing trade: 20 total. Average trades per day: 4.2. Rule violations: 7 (35% violation rate). Days starting with a winning trade: 24 total. Average trades per day: 2.8. Rule violations: 1 (4% violation rate). Trades taken after losses: 'Revenge' emotion tagged 28% of time. Pattern: Opening losses trigger increased trading activity and higher rule violation rate."


**What pattern reveals**: Loss events correlate with behavioral changes (increased trading, revenge emotion, rule violations).


**What pattern does NOT say**: "Stop trading after a loss" or "Take a break to reset" (coaching/advice).


### Pattern 5: High Conviction Setup Quality


**Detected Across**:
- Psychology Tracking: Conviction 7-10 trades: 68% win rate, +$134 avg P&L
- Rules Dashboard: High conviction trades: 95% plan adherence (vs 65% overall)
- Execution Recap: High conviction entry screenshots show clean setups, multiple confluence factors


**Pattern Statement (Clinical)**:
> "Trades with entry conviction 7-10: 28 total, 68% win rate, average P&L +$134, plan adherence 95%. Trades with entry conviction 1-3: 6 total, 17% win rate, average P&L -$156, plan adherence 42%. Trades with entry conviction 4-6: 18 total, 44% win rate, average P&L +$28, plan adherence 68%. Pattern: Higher entry conviction strongly correlates with better outcomes, higher adherence, and larger positive P&L."


**What pattern reveals**: Conviction scores reliably predict performance and discipline across ranges.


**What pattern does NOT say**: "Only take high-conviction trades" (prescriptive strategy advice).


### Pattern 6: Setup-Specific Performance Variance


**Detected Across**:
- Psychology Tracking: "Scalp" tag: 55% win rate. "Swing" tag: 61% win rate. "Reversal" tag: 25% win rate.
- Rules Dashboard: Reversal trades show 42% adherence (vs 71% scalp, 78% swing)
- Execution Recap: Reversal trades show cluttered entry screenshots, multiple false signals


**Pattern Statement (Clinical)**:
> "Trades tagged 'reversal': 12 total, 25% win rate, average P&L -$88. Conviction gap: -4.1 avg. Plan adherence: 42%. Trades tagged 'scalp': 22 total, 55% win rate, average P&L +$45. Conviction gap: -1.8 avg. Plan adherence: 71%. Trades tagged 'swing': 18 total, 61% win rate, average P&L +$112. Conviction gap: -1.4 avg. Plan adherence: 78%. Pattern: Reversal setups significantly underperform other strategies across all metrics."


**What pattern reveals**: Setup type (by tag) reliably differentiates performance and discipline.


**What pattern does NOT say**: "Stop trading reversals" (strategy recommendation).


### Pattern 7: Violation Cascades


**Detected Across**:
- Rules Dashboard: 4 days with 3+ violations (10% of trading days account for 38% of total violations)
- Psychology Tracking: Cascade days show "Frustration" exit emotion 78% of time
- Threads: Cascade trades show rapid sequential entries with declining conviction


**Pattern Statement (Clinical)**:
> "Violation cascade days: 4 total (10% of 40 trading days). Violations per cascade day: 3.75 avg (15 violations / 4 days). Non-cascade days: 24 violations / 36 days (0.67 avg). Cascade days account for 38% of total violations in 10% of trading time. Average P&L on cascade days: -$420. Trades per cascade day: 6.2 avg (vs 2.4 overall). Pattern: Multiple-rule-violation days account for disproportionate share of violations and losses."


**What pattern reveals**: Violations cluster into acute breakdown episodes rather than spreading evenly.


**What pattern does NOT say**: "Stop trading when you violate one rule" (behavioral prescription).

## Pattern vs Noise: Distinguishing Signal


Not every correlation is a meaningful pattern. TradeMonkey applies filters to separate signal from noise:


### Signal (Meaningful Pattern)


**Characteristics**:
- Appears in ≥5 instances
- Shows ≥15% difference from baseline
- Consistent across multiple time periods
- Validated across multiple dimensions


**Example**:
- FOMO trades: 18 instances, 22% win rate (vs 58% baseline = 36% gap)
- Consistent: Week 1: 20%, Week 2: 25%, Week 3: 18% (stable low)
- Multi-dimensional: Low conviction (4.1), poor R:R (1.1:1), frequent regret emotions
- **Verdict**: Strong signal, meaningful pattern


### Noise (Not a Pattern)


**Characteristics**:
- Few instances (<5)
- Small difference from baseline (<10%)
- Inconsistent across time periods
- Only one dimension shows difference


**Example**:
- "Night trades" (10 PM - 2 AM): 3 instances, 33% win rate (vs 58% baseline = 25% gap)
- Small sample (3 trades)
- Inconsistent: Not enough instances to measure consistency
- Single dimension: Only win rate differs, conviction/adherence/P&L similar to baseline
- **Verdict**: Noise, not a pattern (insufficient data)


### Edge Cases


**Example 1: Large Gap, Small Sample**
- "Counter-trend after news" trades: 4 instances, 0% win rate (vs 58% baseline = 58% gap)
- Large gap but only 4 instances (below 5 threshold)
- **Verdict**: Possible pattern, needs more data to confirm


**Example 2: Large Sample, Small Gap**
- Weekend trades: 15 instances, 54% win rate (vs 58% baseline = 4% gap)
- Large sample but gap too small (4% within normal variance)
- **Verdict**: No pattern, performance equivalent to baseline


**Example 3: Inconsistent Pattern**
- "Friday trades": 12 instances
- Week 1-4: 30% win rate (poor)
- Week 5-8: 70% win rate (excellent)
- Large sample but highly inconsistent
- **Verdict**: Not a stable pattern (likely external factors changing, not behavioral constant)


### Dashboard Indicators for Signal vs Noise


**Signal Indicators**:
- ✅ Pattern badge: "Statistically significant"
- ✅ Consistency score: 85%+ (appears reliably)
- ✅ Multi-dimensional icon: Shows correlation across 3+ metrics


**Noise Indicators**:
- ⚠️ Warning badge: "Small sample (3 instances)"
- ⚠️ Consistency score: <60% (unreliable)
- ⚠️ Single-dimensional icon: Only one metric differs


**Users can toggle**: "Show all patterns" (includes noise) vs "Show significant patterns only" (default, filters noise)


## Pattern Hierarchies and Combinations


Patterns can be simple (single factor) or complex (multi-factor). TradeMonkey detects both.


### Single-Factor Patterns


**Definition**: Pattern driven by one primary condition.


**Examples**:
- Time of day: "Afternoon trades underperform"
- Emotion: "FOMO trades lose money"
- Conviction: "Low conviction correlates with poor outcomes"
- Setup: "Reversal trades underperform"


**Detection**: Simple aggregation by single dimension (group by time, emotion, conviction, or tag).


### Two-Factor Patterns


**Definition**: Pattern driven by combination of two conditions.


**Examples**:
- Time + Emotion: "Afternoon FOMO trades underperform more than morning FOMO trades"
- Conviction + Adherence: "Low conviction + plan deviation performs worse than low conviction + plan adherence"
- Emotion + Outcome: "Fear entries that win show 'Relief' exits. Fear entries that lose show 'Regret' exits."


**Detection**: Two-dimensional aggregation (group by dimension A, then sub-group by dimension B).


### Multi-Factor Patterns (3+)


**Definition**: Pattern driven by combination of three or more conditions.


**Examples**:
- Time + Emotion + Context: "Afternoon + FOMO + after losses = 18% win rate"
- Conviction + Adherence + Setup: "Low conviction + non-adherent + reversal trades = 12% win rate"
- Time + Rules + Emotion: "Afternoon + violated 'Max trades' + Revenge emotion = violation cascade risk"


**Detection**: Multi-dimensional aggregation (requires sufficient data in each sub-group).


**Data Requirements**: Multi-factor patterns need 5+ instances in each sub-group. If "Afternoon + FOMO + after losses" only has 3 instances, pattern is noise.


### Pattern Hierarchy Example


**Level 1 (Single Factor)**: "Afternoon trades: 38% win rate (vs 68% morning)"


**Level 2 (Two Factors)**: "Afternoon + FOMO: 20% win rate (vs 40% morning FOMO)"


**Level 3 (Three Factors)**: "Afternoon + FOMO + after losses: 18% win rate (vs 22% afternoon FOMO without prior losses)"


**Insight**: Each additional factor refines the pattern. Most significant pattern: Afternoon + FOMO + after losses (18% win rate, 9 instances).


**AI Deep Dive Explorer specializes in multi-factor exploration**: User can drill from Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 through follow-up questions.


![Pattern Hierarchies](/img/pattern-hierarchies.png)


## Limitations and Data Requirements


Execution pattern detection has several limitations and requirements:


### Minimum Data Volume


**For single-factor patterns**: 20-30 trades with complete data


**For two-factor patterns**: 50+ trades (enough instances in each sub-group)


**For three-factor patterns**: 100+ trades (sufficient multi-dimensional data)


**Example**:
- 30 total trades
- Can detect: "FOMO underperforms" (single factor, if 5+ FOMO trades)
- Cannot detect: "Afternoon FOMO after losses" (multi-factor, insufficient sub-group instances)


### Requires Full Psychological Metadata


**Critical fields for pattern detection**:
- Emotions (entry and exit)
- Conviction scores (entry and exit)
- Plan adherence (entry and exit)
- Tags (setup types, session markers)


**If data is incomplete**:
- 50% of trades missing emotions → Emotion-based patterns unreliable
- 80% of trades missing conviction → Conviction patterns impossible
- No tags → Setup-specific patterns unavailable


**Dashboard shows data completeness**:
```
Pattern Detection Data Quality:
- Emotions: 88% complete (53 / 60 trades)
- Conviction: 95% complete (57 / 60 trades)
- Adherence: 92% complete (55 / 60 trades)
- Tags: 78% complete (47 / 60 trades)


Verdict: Sufficient data for reliable pattern detection.
```


### Pattern Detection Lag


**Patterns emerge over time**: Immediate feedback not possible


**Timeline**:
- Week 1 (5-10 trades): Too early, no patterns
- Week 2-3 (20-30 trades): Single-factor patterns begin appearing
- Week 4-8 (50-100 trades): Multi-factor patterns emerge
- Month 3+ (200+ trades): Stable, reliable patterns


**Example**:
- After 10 trades: AI Diagnostics may say "Insufficient data for pattern detection"
- After 30 trades: AI Diagnostics surfaces 2-3 single-factor patterns
- After 60 trades: AI Diagnostics surfaces 5-7 patterns including multi-factor


### Patterns Reflect Past, Not Future


**Patterns are descriptive, not predictive**:


- "FOMO trades have lost money historically" ≠ "Your next FOMO trade will lose"
- "Afternoon trades underperform" ≠ "All afternoon trades will underperform"


**Patterns show tendencies**: Probabilistic, not deterministic. Use for awareness, not as trading signals.


### External Factors Not Captured


**TradeMonkey cannot detect**:
- Market conditions (volatility, trending vs ranging)
- News events (unless manually tagged)
- Personal life factors (stress, illness, fatigue)
- Strategy changes (unless reflected in tags)


**Pattern might be confounded by external factors**:


**Example**:
- Pattern detected: "Week 3-4 trades underperformed"
- Actual cause: Major market event (Fed rate decision)
- TradeMonkey shows pattern but cannot identify external cause


**User must provide context**: If pattern appears suddenly, consider external factors.


### Pattern Stability Depends on Consistency


**Patterns can change** if behavior or conditions change:


**Example**:
- Pattern detected (Weeks 1-8): "Afternoon trades: 38% win rate"
- Weeks 9-12: Trader stops trading afternoons
- Pattern no longer applies (behavior changed)


**Pattern recency matters**: Always check if pattern is current (use Last 30 Days filter) or historical (All Time).


### Small Sub-Group Instability


**Multi-factor patterns with small sub-groups are volatile**:


**Example**:
- "Afternoon + FOMO + after losses": 18% win rate (9 instances)
- Add 2 wins to sub-group: Win rate jumps to 36% (4 wins, 7 losses out of 11)
- Pattern is real but unstable due to small sample


**Dashboard notes instability**:
> "Pattern: Afternoon + FOMO + after losses (18% win rate, 9 instances). Note: Small sample, pattern may be volatile."


### Correlation Is Not Causation


**Patterns show correlation**: A correlates with B. Patterns do NOT prove A causes B.


**Example**:
- Pattern: "FOMO trades lose money"
- Possible causality:
  1. FOMO emotion → poor decision-making → losses (causal)
  2. Trades that lose → retrospectively tagged as FOMO (hindsight bias)
  3. FOMO occurs during volatile conditions → volatility causes losses (confounding variable)


**TradeMonkey shows correlation**: User must interpret causality based on context.


### Pattern Detection Does Not Prescribe Action


**Patterns reveal behavior**: They do not tell you what to do.


**Example**:
- Pattern: "Afternoon trades underperform"
- Possible responses:
  1. Stop trading afternoons (avoid pattern)
  2. Adjust position sizing in afternoons (risk management)
  3. Create stricter afternoon rules (increase accountability)
  4. Accept afternoon performance (conscious choice)
  5. Investigate why afternoons differ (deeper analysis)


**TradeMonkey does not choose for you**: Patterns are inputs for decision-making, not decisions themselves.


## Summary


Execution patterns are statistically meaningful recurring behaviors detected across psychology, compliance, outcomes, timing, and context. They qualify as patterns when:


- Appearing in ≥5 instances
- Showing ≥15% difference from baseline
- Consistent across time periods
- Validated across multiple dimensions


Patterns feed into AI Diagnostics, Deep Dive Explorer, Time-Scoped Analytics, Rules Dashboard, and Execution Recap to provide clinical, factual insights without coaching or prescription.


Pattern detection requires sufficient data (20-30 trades minimum, 100+ for multi-factor patterns) with complete psychological metadata (emotions, conviction, adherence, tags).


Patterns are descriptive mirrors reflecting past behavior, not predictive signals for future outcomes.
