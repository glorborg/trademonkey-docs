# AI Diagnostics

## What AI Diagnostics Is

AI Diagnostics is a **single-pass analytical summary** that scans your recent trading data and surfaces **behavioral patterns**.

It focuses on **what the data shows**, not what you should do.

> Core question: **“What patterns exist in my recent trading behavior?”**

AI Diagnostics is:
- **One-shot**: You request a report, it runs once, and returns a structured summary.
- **Broad**: It scans emotions, conviction, adherence, rules, timing, outcomes, and tags.
- **Clinical**: It describes correlations and patterns without judgment or advice.

It does **not**:
- Have a conversation.
- Explore one pattern deeply.
- Tell you how to fix anything.

## Role in the AI Feature Stack

AI Diagnostics works alongside other AI features:

- **AI Diagnostics (Breadth)**
  - Scans across all dimensions.
  - Returns 5–10 key findings.
  - One-way, single report.
  - Use when: *“What’s going on in my trading overall?”*

- **AI Deep Dive Explorer (Depth)**
  - Conversational Q&A.
  - Explores **one pattern** in detail.
  - Use when: *“Why does this specific pattern happen?”*

- **Trade Thread Summary (Narrative)**
  - Analyzes **one trade’s timeline**.
  - Explains what happened in that trade.

- **Rules Coach (Configuration)**
  - Helps design and explain rules.
  - Ties findings into concrete rule definitions.

Typical workflow:
1. Run **AI Diagnostics** → identify patterns.
2. Use **Deep Dive Explorer** on the most important pattern(s).
3. Use **Trade Thread Summary** for key trades mentioned.
4. Use **Rules Coach** if you decide to enforce new rules.

## What Inputs AI Diagnostics Uses

AI Diagnostics looks at **all closed trades** in the selected scope (e.g. last 30 days or last 50 trades), prioritizing psychological and behavioral dimensions.

### Core Inputs

- **Trade Financial Data**
  - Entry / exit prices  
  - Position size  
  - Realized P&L  
  - Stop loss / Take profit (if set)  
  - Entry / exit timestamps  
  - Trade status (closed only)

- **Emotion Data**
  - Entry emotions (up to 3 per trade)
  - Exit emotions (up to 3 per trade)
  - Emotion frequency counts
  - Entry → Exit emotional transitions

- **Conviction Scores**
  - Entry conviction (1–10)
  - Exit conviction (1–10)
  - Conviction gap = Exit − Entry
  - Distribution of gap sizes (small / large drops)

- **Plan Adherence**
  - Entry adherence: Yes / Partial / No
  - Exit adherence: Yes / Partial / No
  - Overall adherence percentage
  - Performance by adherence state

- **Rules vs Reality**
  - Which rules were evaluated
  - Which rules were violated
  - Violation frequency per rule
  - Timing (at entry, during trade, at exit)
  - Overall rule adherence score

### Secondary Inputs (If Present)

- **Tags**
  - Setup tags (e.g. breakout, pullback, reversal)
  - Session tags (e.g. london-session, new-york-open)
  - Strategy tags (e.g. scalp, swing)
  - Performance by tag

- **Notes & Reflections**
  - Entry notes (why you took the trade)
  - Exit notes (why you closed it)
  - Post-trade reflections
  - Recurring themes / phrases

- **Time-Based Data**
  - Time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
  - Day of week
  - Trade duration

> Screenshots are not directly processed by AI; they matter for **human review**, not Diagnostics logic.

### Minimum Data Volume

- **Minimum**: ~20 closed trades with decent psychology data.
- **Recommended**: 50+ trades.
- **Best**: 100+ trades with consistent emotions + conviction + adherence.

If data is sparse, the report will explicitly note limited completeness.

## Expected Output: Structure & Style

AI Diagnostics returns a **structured report**, typically including:

- Timestamp
- Number of trades analyzed
- Data completeness (emotions/conviction/adherence coverage)
- 5–10 key findings, ordered by significance

### Standard Finding Format

Each finding follows this pattern:

- **Pattern Name**  
- **Observation** – what the pattern is.
- **Evidence** – concrete numbers (counts, percentages, P&L).
- **Context** – when/where it shows up (session, tags, after losses, etc.).
- **No prescription** – no advice, only description.

### Example (Format)

```text
AI DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
Generated: 2025-01-15 19:42
Trades Analyzed: 52 (Last 30 Days)
Data Completeness: Emotions 94%, Conviction 98%, Adherence 96%


FINDING 1: Conviction Decay During Execution
Your conviction drops an average of 4.2 points from entry to exit on losing trades,
but only 0.8 points on winning trades. Of 23 trades with conviction gap < -4, 19 (83%)
were closed before stop loss or take profit was hit. Average P&L on these early exits: -$88.

Evidence: Losers – Entry conviction 7.4 avg, Exit 3.2. Winners – Entry 7.6, Exit 6.8.
