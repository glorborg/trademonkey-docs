# Execution Recap


## What Execution Recap Is


Execution Recap is a visual review workflow that displays your trades as before/after snapshots. Each trade shows:


- Entry chart screenshot (what price action looked like when you opened)
- Exit chart screenshot (what price action looked like when you closed)
- Entry emotions, conviction, and plan adherence
- Exit emotions, conviction, and plan adherence
- P&L result


Recap is not a gallery or archive. It is a pattern detection tool. By viewing multiple trades in sequence, you can identify execution patterns that are invisible when reviewing trades individually. These patterns feed into Time-Scoped Analytics and AI Diagnostics.


## Why Entry and Exit Screenshots Matter


Screenshots provide visual context that financial data cannot capture. Two trades with identical P&L outcomes can have completely different psychological contexts:


- **Trade A**: Entered on a clean breakout, exited at target after smooth run
- **Trade B**: Entered on a fakeout, endured whipsaw, panic sold near breakout point


Both trades might show the same symbol, entry price, and exit price in a CSV. But the screenshots reveal the difference. Trade A shows a disciplined execution. Trade B shows a chaotic execution that happened to break even.


Screenshots also expose behavioral drift:


- Entry screenshot shows a textbook setup (high conviction entry makes sense)
- Exit screenshot shows you closed in the middle of a pullback, nowhere near your stop loss or take profit (low conviction exit reveals panic or impatience)


This before/after visual pairing creates accountability. You cannot rationalize a panic exit if the exit screenshot shows price was still 20 pips above your stop.

## What Data Execution Recap Uses


### Visual Context
- **Entry Chart Screenshot**: Captured at or near entry time, showing what you saw when you decided to open the trade
- **Exit Chart Screenshot**: Captured at or near exit time, showing what you saw when you decided to close the trade


Screenshots are optional but strongly recommended. If missing, Recap displays a placeholder or skips the visual comparison.


### Psychological Context
- **Entry Emotions**: What you felt when entering (confident, fearful, impulsive, calm, etc.)
- **Entry Conviction**: How confident you were in the setup (1-10 scale)
- **Entry Plan Adherence**: Whether you followed your entry rules (Yes / Partial / No)


- **Exit Emotions**: What you felt when exiting (relief, regret, pride, frustration, satisfied)
- **Exit Conviction**: How confident you were in the exit decision (1-10 scale)
- **Exit Plan Adherence**: Whether you followed your exit plan (Yes / Partial / No)


### Financial Context
- **P&L**: Profit or loss in currency
- **Win/Loss**: Binary outcome (green for profit, red for loss)
- **Entry and Exit Prices**: Displayed alongside screenshots for reference


### Temporal Context
- **Trade Date and Time**: When the trade occurred
- **Session or Time of Day**: If you tag trades by session (London, New York, Asian), Recap can group them accordingly


## How Execution Recap Ties to Pattern Discovery


Recap is designed for sequential review. When you view 10-20 trades in order, patterns emerge:


### Conviction Decay Patterns
You notice that five trades show entry conviction of 8-9, but exit conviction of 3-4. All five exit screenshots show you closed during minor pullbacks, not at your planned stop loss. Pattern detected: You enter strong but panic exit on volatility.


### Session-Based Deterioration
You notice that trades taken before 10 AM (entry screenshots show clean setups, high conviction, disciplined exits) perform well. Trades taken after 2 PM (entry screenshots show late-stage breakouts, low conviction, impulsive entries) perform poorly. Pattern detected: Afternoon trading is emotionally driven, not setup-driven.


### Emotion-Result Correlation
You notice that trades tagged with "FOMO" or "Impatience" at entry consistently show choppy price action in the entry screenshot. These trades rarely reach your take profit. Pattern detected: FOMO entries occur during low-quality setups, not high-probability setups.


### Setup vs Execution Mismatch
You notice that winning trades show aligned emotions (Confident → Satisfied or Calm → Relief). Losing trades show emotional reversal (Confident → Regret or Calm → Frustration). Pattern detected: Emotional shift during trade execution predicts dissatisfaction, even when the trade is rule-compliant.


These patterns are invisible in spreadsheets or P&L summaries. Recap surfaces them by forcing you to review the visual and psychological context of each trade in sequence.

## Clinical Examples of Patterns Users Notice


### Example 1: Afternoon Deterioration
> "I reviewed 40 trades in Recap. Trades 1-20 (morning session) show clean entry screenshots, conviction scores of 7-9, and adherence marked 'Yes.' Exit screenshots show disciplined exits at target or stop. Trades 21-40 (afternoon session) show cluttered entry screenshots, conviction scores of 4-6, and adherence marked 'Partial' or 'No.' Exit screenshots show I closed mid-trade, often before stop or target was hit. Afternoon trades averaged -$85 per trade. Morning trades averaged +$120 per trade."


### Example 2: Conviction Drop on Reversals
> "I reviewed 30 trades filtered by 'Frustration' exit emotion. Entry screenshots show strong directional moves (high conviction entries make sense). Exit screenshots show price reversed and I closed at or near breakeven. Entry conviction averaged 8.2. Exit conviction averaged 3.1. Gap: -5.1. I consistently lose confidence when price pulls back, even though pullbacks are normal."


### Example 3: FOMO Entries During News
> "I reviewed trades tagged 'FOMO.' Entry screenshots show large candles and high volatility. Exit screenshots show whipsaw and stop-outs. Timestamps show these trades occurred within 30 minutes of scheduled news events. My 'No trading during news' rule was violated 12 times this month. Average loss per FOMO-news trade: -$180."


### Example 4: Overtrading After Losses
> "I reviewed trades sorted by time. After each losing trade, the next 2-3 trades show lower conviction scores and 'Revenge' or 'Impatience' emotions. Entry screenshots show weaker setups (late breakouts, no pullback, counter-trend). These revenge-cluster trades lost $1,400 total. Isolated trades (no preceding loss) won $2,100 total."


These observations are factual and clinical. They describe what the data shows, not what the trader "should" do. The mirror reflects the pattern. The trader decides how to respond.


## How Execution Recap Strengthens Later Features


### Time-Scoped Analytics
Time-Scoped Analytics allows you to filter trades by date range and compare performance metrics. If you've reviewed trades in Recap and noticed session-based deterioration, you can use Time-Scoped Analytics to quantify it:


- Filter to "Morning trades only" → Win rate: 68%
- Filter to "Afternoon trades only" → Win rate: 32%
- Compare conviction scores, adherence percentages, and P&L across time windows


Recap identifies the pattern visually. Time-Scoped Analytics measures it numerically.


### AI Deep Dive Explorer
AI Deep Dive Explorer generates specific insights based on your trade data. If you've noticed patterns in Recap (e.g., low conviction exits), you can ask Explorer:


- "Why does my conviction drop so much from entry to exit?"
- "What happens to my trades when I exit with conviction below 5?"
- "Do afternoon trades with low conviction perform differently than morning trades with low conviction?"


The AI uses your screenshots, emotions, conviction scores, and timestamps to answer. The more complete your Recap data, the more specific the AI's responses.


### Rules vs Reality Dashboard
Rules vs Reality tracks violations of your self-imposed rules. If Recap reveals that you frequently close trades before your stop or target is hit (exit plan adherence: No), you can create a rule:


- "Do not exit until stop loss or take profit is hit"


The system will then flag violations automatically on future trades. Recap identifies the gap. Rules vs Reality enforces accountability going forward.


### Behavioral Insights Section
Behavioral Insights aggregates patterns across your trades. If Recap shows that "FOMO" trades consistently lose money, Behavioral Insights will surface:


- "FOMO-tagged trades: 12 instances, 25% win rate, -$2,160 total cost"
- "Highest emotional cost emotion: FOMO"


Recap is the discovery phase. Behavioral Insights is the aggregation phase.

## Execution Recap Workflow


### Step 1: Filter or Sort Your Trades
Recap works best when reviewing trades in a meaningful sequence:


- **By Date**: Review trades chronologically to detect time-based patterns (session deterioration, weekly trends)
- **By Account**: Review one challenge account at a time to isolate psychological context
- **By Emotion**: Filter to "FOMO" or "Revenge" trades to see common entry patterns
- **By P&L**: Sort by biggest losses or biggest wins to identify outlier behavior


Choose a filter that matches what you want to investigate.


### Step 2: Review Entry Context
For each trade, observe:


- Entry screenshot: What did price action look like?
- Entry emotion: What did you feel?
- Entry conviction: How confident were you?
- Entry adherence: Did you follow your plan?


Ask yourself: Does the screenshot support the conviction score? If you marked conviction as 9, does the screenshot show a clean, high-probability setup? If you marked adherence as "Yes," does the screenshot confirm you waited for your entry criteria?


### Step 3: Review Exit Context
For the same trade, observe:


- Exit screenshot: What did price action look like when you closed?
- Exit emotion: What did you feel?
- Exit conviction: How confident were you in the exit?
- Exit adherence: Did you follow your exit plan?


Ask yourself: Does the exit screenshot show a planned exit (stop or target hit) or an emotional exit (panic sold on pullback, closed "just to lock in profit")? If conviction dropped significantly from entry to exit, why? What changed?


### Step 4: Compare P&L to Execution Quality
A winning trade can have poor execution. A losing trade can have excellent execution.


- **Good execution, bad result**: Entry screenshot shows clean setup, high conviction, exit screenshot shows you were stopped out as planned. Loss is acceptable. No behavioral issue detected.
- **Poor execution, good result**: Entry screenshot shows weak setup, low conviction, exit screenshot shows you panic closed but price happened to be in profit. Win is luck, not skill. Behavioral issue exists.


Recap reveals when you're getting lucky despite poor discipline, or unlucky despite good discipline.


### Step 5: Note Patterns and Hypotheses
As you review 10-20 trades, write down observations:


- "Five trades show conviction drop of 5+ points. All five closed during pullbacks, not at planned levels."
- "Trades after 2 PM show weaker entry screenshots and lower adherence percentages."
- "FOMO trades (7 instances) all show large candles in entry screenshots and whipsaw in exit screenshots."


These observations become hypotheses to test in Time-Scoped Analytics or AI Deep Dive Explorer.


## Screenshot Optionality and Placeholder Behavior


### Screenshots Are Optional
Not all traders capture screenshots for every trade. TradeMonkey does not require them. If you log a trade without screenshots, Recap displays:


- Emotion, conviction, adherence, and P&L data as usual
- A placeholder image or text label where screenshots would appear (e.g., "No entry screenshot available")


The psychological and financial data is still usable. The visual context is missing.


### When to Skip Screenshots
Screenshots add significant value but also add friction. Consider skipping screenshots if:


- You trade very frequently (scalpers taking 20+ trades per session may find screenshot capture too slow)
- You trade on mobile or in situations where screenshot tools are unavailable
- You import trades via CSV and don't have access to historical chart images


For these cases, Recap focuses on emotion, conviction, and adherence data. Visual pattern detection is limited, but psychological pattern detection remains functional.


### When to Prioritize Screenshots
Screenshots are most valuable for:


- **Significant trades**: Big wins, big losses, rule violations, emotionally charged trades
- **Learning phases**: Early in your TradeMonkey usage, when you're still discovering your patterns
- **Challenge accounts**: If you're repeatedly failing prop challenges, screenshots can reveal execution issues that P&L alone won't show


A hybrid approach works well: Capture screenshots for 20-30% of your trades (the most psychologically significant ones), skip screenshots for routine trades.


### Batch Screenshot Upload
If you trade on a platform that saves chart screenshots automatically (e.g., TradingView snapshots, MT5 screenshot folder), you can upload screenshots in batches after the session. Match them to trades by timestamp. This is slower than real-time capture but better than no screenshots.


## Limitations & Notes


### Recap Requires Psychology Data
If you import trades via CSV without adding emotions, conviction, or adherence, Recap becomes a simple trade list with screenshots. The pattern detection value drops significantly. Recap works best when psychological context is complete.


### Visual Patterns Are Subjective
Two traders can view the same entry screenshot and draw different conclusions. Recap does not interpret screenshots for you. It presents them alongside your self-reported data (conviction, emotions) so you can identify mismatches or patterns.


### Screenshot Quality Matters
Low-resolution or poorly framed screenshots reduce pattern detection value. Best practices:


- Capture enough context (15-30 minutes of price action before entry, not just the entry candle)
- Use consistent timeframes (if you trade on 5-minute charts, screenshot the 5-minute chart)
- Include indicators or levels you reference (support/resistance, moving averages, etc.)


### Recap Is a Discovery Tool, Not a Fix
Recap shows you patterns. It does not prescribe solutions. If you notice afternoon deterioration, Recap won't tell you to "stop trading after 2 PM." It will show you the data. You decide how to respond (create a rule, adjust your schedule, investigate why afternoons are different, etc.).


### Memory Bias Affects Retroactive Review
If you review trades weeks or months after they occurred, your memory of the context is distorted. Recap works best when screenshots and psychology data are captured close to execution time. Reviewing old trades is still useful, but patterns may reflect hindsight bias.


### Not All Patterns Are Actionable
Some patterns you discover in Recap may not have clear solutions. For example, you might notice that "Calm" entry emotions correlate with breakeven trades (not wins or losses). This is an observation, not necessarily a problem. Recap surfaces all patterns. You filter for actionable ones.
