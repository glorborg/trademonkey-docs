# Calendar & News Events

## Purpose

Calendar & News Events is **not** a generic economic calendar. It is an **execution context guardrail** designed to protect discipline during scheduled volatility — especially for challenge traders and rule-based workflows.

Its core job is to answer:

> “Are you trading during scheduled uncertainty you said you’d avoid?”

It does this by:

- Highlighting **high-impact scheduled events** (CPI, NFP, FOMC, rate decisions, etc.)
- Defining **volatility windows** before/after those events
- Enforcing **news-based rules** via the Rules vs Reality engine
- Creating **predictable avoidance zones** around high-risk periods

This is a **protective layer**, not a strategy or prediction tool.

## What This Feature Is NOT

To avoid confusion with full economic calendars (ForexFactory, MyFxBook, broker calendars):

**It is NOT:**

- A full economic calendar with every low/medium/high event  
- A forecasting tool (no forecasts, actuals, or “beats/misses” logic)
- A signal generator or trade idea source
- A sentiment/positioning dashboard
- A real-time, intraday news feed

**It IS:**

- A **curated list of high-impact events only**
- Integrated tightly with **Rules vs Reality** for:
  - time-based restrictions
  - violation detection
  - post-trade review

## What the Calendar Surfaces

The Calendar & News Events feature provides five execution-relevant elements.

### 1. High-Impact Events

Curated macro events that commonly cause large moves and execution risk:

- **Monetary policy**: FOMC, ECB/BOE/BOJ/RBA/SNB rate decisions, statements, minutes
- **Employment**: NFP, US unemployment rate, major employment releases
- **Inflation**: CPI, PPI, key CPI prints for majors (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- **Growth / Activity**: Major GDP releases, key retail sales, select high-impact prints

**Event fields:**

- Title (e.g. `US Non-Farm Payrolls`)
- Description (short context)
- Time (in your configured timezone)
- Currency (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.)
- Impact level (high)
- Optional duration metadata

No forecasts, actual values, or previous values are stored.

---

### 2. Volatility Windows

Every high-impact event defines a **volatility window** around its scheduled time:

- **Pre-event window**: X minutes before event (e.g. 15 / 30 / 60)
- **Post-event window**: Y minutes after event (e.g. 15 / 30 / 60)

Example:

- Event: US CPI at **8:30 AM**
- Pre: 8:00–8:30
- Post: 8:30–9:00  
→ Volatility window: **8:00–9:00**

These windows are what your rules reference and what the Rules vs Reality engine uses for violation checks.

---

### 3. Restricted News Zones (Rule-Based)

News rules turn volatility windows into **restricted zones** where trading is not allowed (according to your own rules).

Typical behaviors:

- “No trading ±30 minutes around high-impact USD events”
- “No trades if high-impact news is within 15 minutes ahead”
- “No trading pairs whose currencies have high-impact news within ±30 minutes”

When a trade’s timestamp falls inside one of these restricted zones, Rules vs Reality flags a **news violation** and logs:

- Which rule was evaluated
- Which event triggered the restriction
- How many minutes before/after the event the trade occurred

---

### 4. Session Context

Calendar data is layered on top of your session structure (Asian / London / New York):

- Shows **which sessions** contain high-impact events
- Helps reconcile **session rules** (e.g. “London only”) with **news rules** (e.g. “Avoid FOMC days”)
- Makes it obvious when your “normal trading hours” are mostly blocked by news

Example:

> UK CPI at 7:00 AM inside London session → London session is partially or fully blocked by news rules.

---

### 5. Visual Cueing of High-Risk Periods

In calendar or timeline views, the feature visually marks elevated-risk windows:

- Red/blocked bands around news times
- Event markers at release timestamps
- Shaded ranges during pre/post volatility windows

This lets you **pre-scan** your day and immediately see:

- “Clean” periods
- “Red zones” around events
- Days that may not be worth trading at all

---

## Integration With Rules vs Reality

Calendar & News Events is designed primarily to power **news-based rules** inside the Rules vs Reality engine.

### How Rule Evaluation Works

For each new trade:

1. Convert trade timestamp and event timestamps to a common time basis (UTC internally, displayed in your timezone).
2. For each active news rule:
   - Find relevant events (by currency, impact level, and time window).
   - Compute pre/post windows around event(s).
   - Check if entry (and optionally exit) timestamps fall inside any restricted window.
3. If they do, log a **VIOLATION** with:
   - Rule name
   - Linked trade
   - Linked event
   - Minutes to/from the event
   - Plain-language reason (e.g. “Trade opened 12 minutes before CPI release”)

These evaluations show up in the **Rules vs Reality Dashboard** and can be filtered, grouped, and trended like any other rule.

### Supported News-Based Rule Types

The engine supports several common patterns.

#### 1. No Trading Around Events (±X Minutes)

**Definition**

> “No trading within X minutes before and Y minutes after high-impact events for currency C.”

- Uses an event’s pre/post window to define a blocked range.
- Applies to all trades in affected instruments, according to rule config.

Example:

- Rule: `No trading ±30 minutes around high-impact USD events`
- Event: US CPI at 8:30
- Window: 8:00–9:00
- Trade at 8:15 → **Violation**

---

#### 2. No Trading If Event Is Imminent (Look-Ahead Only)

**Definition**

> “No trading if there is a high-impact event for currency C within N minutes ahead.”

- Only looks **forward** from trade time (pre-event avoidance).
- Often used by traders willing to trade post-news, but not pre-news.

Example:

- Rule: `No trading if high-impact USD event within 15 minutes`
- Event: NFP at 8:30
- Trade at 8:20 → Event is 10 minutes ahead → **Violation**
- Trade at 8:40 → Event already released → **Pass**

---

#### 3. No Trading Pairs Whose Currencies Have News

**Definition**

> “No trading symbol X/Y when either X or Y has a high-impact event within a defined window.”

- Extracts both currencies from the pair.
- Checks events for **either** side (e.g. EUR *or* USD).
- Used by traders who want zero exposure to any news on either leg.

Example:

- Rule: `No trading EURUSD ±30 minutes around EUR or USD high-impact events`
- ECB decision at 7:45, US CPI at 8:30
- Trade EURUSD at 8:00 → Inside post-ECB and pre-CPI windows → **Violation**

### System Tags

Calendar context also drives automatic **system tags** for trades, even if no explicit rule is violated:

- `sys:news-window` – Trade inside a broad news window (e.g. ±60 minutes)
- `sys:pre-news` – Trade opened before event in pre-window
- `sys:post-news` – Trade opened after event in post-window
- `sys:violated-news-rule` – Trade violated a news-based rule

These tags feed into **Execution Patterns**, AI Diagnostics, and analytics to show how “trading near news” behaves across your history.

---

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Pre-Session: Scan the Day

Before trading:

1. Open calendar view or widget.
2. Look at **today’s high-impact events** and their windows.
3. Mark **restricted zones** based on your rules (e.g. ±30 minutes).
4. Decide:
   - Whether to trade at all today.
   - Which hours are realistically “clean.”

Example:

> “CPI at 8:30 and FOMC at 2:00 → I’ll only consider trading 9:30–12:00. No afternoon trades.”

### 2. During Session: Guardrails Against Impulses

When a setup appears:

1. Check time vs upcoming/ongoing events.
2. Compare with your news rules (e.g. “no trades within 30 minutes of news”).
3. If inside a restricted window, you know **this is a rule break**, not just “a bit risky.”

This helps:

- Reduce FOMO entries right before news.
- Avoid chasing moves immediately after releases.
- Maintain consistency with your stated plan, even when setups look tempting.

---

### 3. Post-Session: Review Trades Near Events

After trading:

1. Open Rules vs Reality Dashboard.
2. Filter for:
   - News-rule violations
   - Trades tagged `sys:news-window`
3. For each trade, review:
   - Which event it was near
   - How many minutes before/after the event it occurred
   - Emotions, conviction, plan adherence
   - Outcome (P&L, slippage, execution quality)

Over time, this reveals patterns such as:

- “Pre-news entries are low-conviction and often FOMO.”
- “News-window trades have worse slippage and worse R:R.”
- “News violations frequently start multi-rule violation cascades.”

The system **describes** these patterns; you decide what, if anything, to change.

## Why It Matters for Challenge Traders

For prop firm challenges and funded accounts, news guardrails are especially important:

- **Preventing account blowouts**
  - High-impact events can cause large spikes and slippage that exceed daily loss limits.
  - News guardrails help avoid “one-event challenge failure” days.

- **Reducing slippage**
  - News windows are where stop fills are most unreliable.
  - Trading outside these windows improves average execution quality.

- **Aligning with prop firm rules**
  - Many firms explicitly restrict news trading.
  - You can mirror those into TradeMonkey rules and see violations before the prop firm does.

- **Creating predictable routines**
  - You know in advance which hours are “off limits.”
  - This reduces randomness in daily risk and P&L swings.

---

## Limitations and Clarifications

- **High-Impact Only (by design)**  
  Calendar is **curated** to major events (CPI, NFP, FOMC, key central bank decisions, major GDP prints).  
  Medium/low-impact releases are typically not included in MVP.

- **No forecasts/actuals/sentiment**  
  The feature does not show consensus forecasts, actual values, previous values, revisions, or positioning.  
  Use external calendars if you need those; TradeMonkey’s calendar exists for **guardrails**, not analysis.

- **Depends on your timezone setting**  
  Events are stored in UTC and displayed in your configured timezone.  
  Incorrect timezone settings will make windows and violation timing inaccurate.

- **Not synced with broker calendars**  
  Broker-specific restrictions/holidays are not automatically mirrored.  
  If needed, model them as additional manual rules.

- **Scheduled times only**  
  The system uses scheduled release times. If events are delayed or early, the calendar does not adjust in real time.

- **Rules are not retroactive**  
  Adding a news-based rule today does not re-label old trades.  
  Historical violations reflect only rules that existed at the time.

## How It Fits Into the Execution Mirror

Calendar & News Events completes the picture by adding **time- and event-based context** to:

- **Plan vs Execution** – Did you follow the plan?
- **State vs Outcome** – What mental state led to which results?
- **Rules vs Reality** – Did you follow your rules?
- **Calendar & News Events** – Did you trade during scheduled uncertainty you chose to avoid?

It doesn’t tell you what to trade. It simply makes it impossible to say:

> “I didn’t realize there was news then.”

The data will show exactly when you chose to step into, or avoid, scheduled volatility.
