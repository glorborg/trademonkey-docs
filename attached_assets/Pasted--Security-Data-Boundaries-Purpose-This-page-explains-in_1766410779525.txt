# Security & Data Boundaries

## Purpose

This page explains, in plain terms, how TradeMonkey protects your data and where the security boundary ends.  
TradeMonkey is a Behavior Dashcam, not a brokerage, trading platform, or account manager. It records your decisions and reflections so you can see your execution clearly — and nothing more.

## What TradeMonkey Records

TradeMonkey records only the information you intentionally log, including:
- Trades (manual or imported)
- Rules and limits you define
- Reflections, emotions, conviction, and plan adherence
- Screenshots or notes you attach
- Analytics derived from your own data

TradeMonkey does not place trades, access broker accounts, or interact with markets on your behalf.

## Who Can See Your Data

Only you — and anyone you explicitly grant access to within your account — can see your data.  
Your trades, reflections, rules, and analytics are isolated to your account and are not visible to other users.  
TradeMonkey does not sell, share, or expose your trading data to other customers.

## When AI Is Involved

Some features use AI to analyze patterns, not to make decisions for you.  
Most AI insights are generated from aggregated metrics, such as:
- Win rates
- Rule adherence
- Emotional frequency
- Performance by context or time

Reflection Analysis is optional.  
If you choose to analyze a written reflection, the text you submit is sent for analysis only when you explicitly request it (for example, by clicking “Analyze with AI”).  
If you don’t request analysis, your reflection remains private and untouched.

AI features do not receive:
- Your name or email
- Login credentials
- Broker account details
- Payment information

## What TradeMonkey Never Sees

TradeMonkey does not have access to:
- Broker usernames or passwords
- Trading platform credentials (MT5, cTrader, TradingView, etc.)
- Payment card numbers
- Orders, executions, or balances in real time

TradeMonkey observes behavior you record, not live trading activity.

## Your Responsibilities

TradeMonkey secures the application and the data you store in it. You remain responsible for:
- Protecting your login credentials
- Securing your devices
- Keeping your browser and operating system up to date
- Managing broker and prop firm security separately

TradeMonkey cannot secure third-party platforms or devices you control.

## Security Questions or Concerns

If you have a security question or believe something isn’t working as expected:

Email: hello@trademonkey.app  
Subject: Security question  
Please describe the issue clearly.  
Do not include passwords or sensitive credentials.

## Summary

TradeMonkey records only what you intentionally log.  
Your data is visible only to your account.  
AI analysis is optional and limited to the context you choose.  
TradeMonkey never accesses broker accounts or payment details.  
You control when and how your data is analyzed.  
The Behavior Dashcam exists to reveal execution truth — not to intrude beyond it.
