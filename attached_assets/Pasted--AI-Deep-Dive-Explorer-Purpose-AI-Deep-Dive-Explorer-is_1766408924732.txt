# AI Deep Dive Explorer

## Purpose

AI Deep Dive Explorer is a conversational analysis tool that helps you observe why-patterns associated with specific outcomes in your trading. It builds on top of your existing analytics and lets you drill into one pattern at a time through focused follow-up questions.

## What The AI Deep Dive Explorer Feature Does:

Uses the trading data you record inside of TradeMonkey (P&L, emotions, conviction, plan adherence, rules, tags, timing) to analyze one pattern of your choice.

Answers questions like:  
"Why does my conviction drop during trades?"  
"When is FOMO most expensive for me?"  
"Under what conditions does my plan adherance break down?"

Lets you ask a short chain of follow-up questions so each answer gets more specific.

Stays descriptive: it shows correlations and conditions, but does not give advice or tell you what to do.

## How to Use It

Spot a pattern  
Use AI Diagnostics, Time-Scoped Analytics, Behavioral Recap, or Rules vs Reality to find something interesting (for example, "afternoon trades underperform" or "FOMO is costly").

Start a Deep Dive  
Open AI Deep Dive Explorer and ask a clear, data-based question:  
"Why do my afternoon trades perform worse than morning trades?"  
"What conditions appear most often in my revenge trades?"

Ask follow-ups  
Use the answers to go deeper:  
Compare times of day, emotions, conviction levels, rule violations, tags, or accounts.  
Keep each follow-up tied to the previous answer ("Does this happen more after losses?" rather than changing the topic completely).

Capture insights  
When you see a pattern that matters (for example, "afternoon + low conviction + FOMO after losses is my worst combo"), write it down or save the transcript.

Decide what to do next  
Use your own judgment to adjust your trading rules, the sessions you trade in, or your trading strategy. Deep Dive shows you your trading behavior patterns; you decide on the response.

## What Data It Uses

Deep Dive Explorer works on aggregated, structured data from your journal, such as:

Win rate and P&L by:  
Emotion  
Conviction range  
Time of day / session  
Tag / setup type  
Rule adherence vs violation

Conviction gaps (entry vs exit) and how they relate to outcomes.

Rule violation patterns (when and where they cluster).

Multi-factor combinations (for example, "afternoon + low conviction + FOMO + after losses").

It does not:

Read or interpret your free-text notes or reflections.

Analyze screenshots or charts.

Know external market conditions, news, or broker details.

Provide personal, psychological, or trading advice.

## Important Notes and Limits

Deep Dive is pattern-specific: it does not scan your whole history on its own. Start from a pattern you've already noticed.

It respects your current time scope where applicable (for example, Last 30 Days vs All Time), so check your filters before starting.

Think of Deep Dive as replaying the footage from multiple angles — not explaining what you should have done.

Results are correlations, not guarantees:  
"Afternoon FOMO trades lost money historically" does not mean the next one must lose.

Deep Dive is descriptive, not prescriptive:  
It will say "FOMO trades have 22% win rate vs 58% for non-FOMO"  
It will not say "Stop trading FOMO setups."

There are daily usage limits and each exploration is capped to a small number of follow-up questions to keep the system fast and stable. Limits may vary by subscription level; if you hit a limit you'll see an in-app message and can try again after the reset.

Past Deep Dive sessions can be revisited, but if you want to keep them permanently, copy notes or save transcripts outside TradeMonkey.

Deep Dive does not replace manual review. Use it alongside Drift Detection, Rules vs Reality, Behavioral Recap, and Trade Recap to validate what you see.
