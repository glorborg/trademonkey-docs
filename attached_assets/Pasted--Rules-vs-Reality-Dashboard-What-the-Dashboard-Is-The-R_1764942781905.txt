# Rules vs Reality Dashboard


## What the Dashboard Is


The Rules vs Reality Dashboard is TradeMonkey's long-term execution mirror for rule adherence. It aggregates rule evaluation data across all trades to show whether you follow the rules you set for yourself.


This is not an analytics vanity page showing performance metrics. It is a behavioral truth instrument that reveals:


- **Adherence over time**: Are you following your rules consistently, or is discipline eroding?
- **Discipline decay trends**: Is adherence declining week-over-week or month-over-month?
- **Violation streaks**: Are rule violations isolated incidents or clustered patterns?
- **Structural rule-breaking patterns**: Which rules are violated most often? Under what conditions?


The dashboard answers: "Do I follow my stated rules? If not, when and why do I break them?"


## Role as Execution Mirror


The Rules vs Reality Dashboard completes TradeMonkey's execution mirror trilogy:


1. **Plan vs Execution**: Did you follow your trade plan? (per-trade adherence flags)
2. **State vs Outcome**: What mental state produced what results? (emotion-based analytics)
3. **Rules vs Reality**: Did you follow your self-imposed rules? (long-term compliance) ← This


The dashboard does not judge whether your rules are good or bad. It only shows whether you follow them. You can have:


- **High adherence + poor performance**: You consistently follow bad rules
- **Low adherence + good performance**: You break your rules but profit anyway (discipline issue remains)
- **High adherence + good performance**: Rules work and you follow them (ideal)
- **Low adherence + poor performance**: You break rules and lose money (double problem)


The dashboard reflects adherence, not effectiveness. Rules Coach helps define rules. Rules vs Reality Dashboard shows whether you follow them.

## What the Dashboard Measures


The dashboard calculates and displays multiple dimensions of rule adherence:


### Global Adherence Score


**Definition**: Percentage of rule evaluations that passed across all trades and all rules.


**Calculation**:
```
Global Adherence Score = (Total Rules Passed) / (Total Rules Evaluated) × 100
```


**Example**:
- 60 trades
- 5 active rules per trade
- 300 total rule evaluations (60 × 5)
- 261 passed, 39 violated
- Global Adherence Score: 87% (261 / 300)


**What it shows**: Overall compliance across all rules. A declining global score indicates behavioral drift.


**What it does NOT show**: Which specific rules are violated, or which conditions trigger violations. For that, use rule-level breakdown.


### Rule-by-Rule Adherence Breakdown


**Definition**: Adherence percentage calculated separately for each rule.


**Calculation**:
```
Rule Adherence = (Times Rule Passed) / (Times Rule Evaluated) × 100
```


**Example**:
- Rule: "Max 3 trades per day"
- Evaluated: 40 trading days
- Passed: 36 days
- Violated: 4 days
- Adherence: 90% (36 / 40)


**Displayed as table**:


| Rule Name | Evaluated | Passed | Violated | Adherence |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Max 3 trades per day | 40 | 36 | 4 | 90% |
| Allowed time window (8-12) | 60 | 52 | 8 | 87% |
| Min 2:1 R:R ratio | 60 | 54 | 6 | 90% |
| No trading after 3 losses | 12 | 9 | 3 | 75% |


**What it shows**: Which rules you follow consistently vs which you break frequently. Identifies weak points in discipline.


### Severity Weighting (Optional)


**Definition**: Not all violations are equally significant. Severity weighting allows more important rules to carry more weight in global adherence score.


**Implementation** (if enabled):
- Daily loss limit violations: Weight × 3 (high severity)
- Time window violations: Weight × 2 (medium severity)
- Tag requirement violations: Weight × 1 (low severity)


**Weighted Calculation**:
```
Weighted Adherence = (Sum of Weighted Passes) / (Sum of Weighted Evaluations) × 100
```


**Example**:
- Daily loss rule violated once (weight 3): -3 points
- Time window rule violated twice (weight 2): -4 points
- Tag rule violated once (weight 1): -1 point
- Weighted score reflects that daily loss violation is more significant


**Note**: Severity weighting is optional and configured per organization. Default: all rules weighted equally.


### Daily and Session-Based Violation Summaries


**Daily Summary**: Count of violations per calendar day.


**Example**:
- Monday: 0 violations (clean day)
- Tuesday: 2 violations (time window, max trades)
- Wednesday: 0 violations
- Thursday: 4 violations (max trades, max loss, no trading after losses, position size)
- Friday: 1 violation (time window)


**What it shows**: Violation clustering by day. Identifies whether violations are isolated or clustered (multi-violation days indicate discipline collapse).


**Session-Based Summary**: Count of violations by time of day or trading session.


**Example**:
- Morning session (8 AM - 12 PM): 2 violations out of 34 trades (6% violation rate)
- Afternoon session (2 PM - 6 PM): 9 violations out of 26 trades (35% violation rate)


**What it shows**: Time-based discipline patterns. Reveals whether violations concentrate in specific sessions.


### Cumulative Violations by Rule Type


**Definition**: Total count of violations per rule since inception or within time window.


**Grouped by rule category**:


| Rule Category | Total Violations |
|---------------|------------------|
| Time & Session | 12 |
| Trade Count & Exposure | 8 |
| Risk & Loss | 5 |
| Behavior & Discipline | 11 |
| Tag Compliance | 3 |


**What it shows**: Which rule types are violated most often. Identifies behavioral weakness areas (e.g., time management vs risk management vs setup discipline).


### Color-Coded Adherence Categories


**Definition**: Visual indicators showing whether adherence is stable, improving, or deteriorating.


**Categories**:


**Stable (Green)**
- Adherence 80-100%
- Recent adherence (Last 20 trades) within 5% of all-time adherence
- Pattern: Consistent compliance


**Deteriorating (Red)**
- Recent adherence (Last 20) is >10% lower than all-time
- Example: All-time 85%, Last 20: 68%
- Pattern: Discipline decay


**Improving (Blue)**
- Recent adherence (Last 20) is >10% higher than all-time
- Example: All-time 65%, Last 20: 82%
- Pattern: Discipline recovery


**Unstable (Yellow)**
- Recent adherence fluctuates >15% between reviews
- Example: Week 1: 90%, Week 2: 65%, Week 3: 88%
- Pattern: Inconsistent discipline


**Color coding applies to**:
- Global adherence score
- Individual rule adherence
- Session-based adherence


**What it shows**: Trajectory of discipline, not just current state. Reveals improvement or relapse even if absolute adherence is moderate.


### Chronic vs Acute Rule Failure


**Chronic Failure**: Rule violated consistently over time, low adherence percentage.


**Criteria**:
- Adherence <60%
- Violations spread across multiple weeks
- No significant improvement in recent window


**Example**:
- Rule: "Max 3 trades per day"
- Adherence: 52% (violated 19 out of 40 days)
- Violations spread across 8 weeks
- Pattern: Chronic overtrading


**Acute Failure**: Rule violated in clusters, high adherence overall but severe lapses.


**Criteria**:
- Adherence >75% overall
- Violations clustered in 1-2 time periods (days, weeks)
- Recent adherence may show spike then recovery


**Example**:
- Rule: "No trading after 3 losses"
- Adherence: 83% (violated 2 out of 12 applicable situations)
- Both violations occurred in same week (losing streak)
- Pattern: Acute breakdown under pressure


**Dashboard indicators**:
- Chronic: "Consistently violated" badge, trend line shows flat low adherence
- Acute: "Violation cluster detected" badge, trend line shows spike then recovery


**What it shows**: Whether discipline issues are systemic (chronic) or situational (acute). Guides intervention strategy.

## Dashboard Components


The dashboard is organized into four main panels:


### 1. Adherence Score Panel


**Location**: Top of dashboard, prominently displayed


**Contents**:
- **Global Adherence Score**: Large percentage (e.g., "87%")
- **Recent vs All-Time Comparison**: "Last 20: 82% | All Time: 87%"
- **Trend Indicator**: Arrow showing improvement, decline, or stability
- **Color Coding**: Green (stable), Red (deteriorating), Blue (improving), Yellow (unstable)


**Score Calculation** (detailed):


**Step 1**: Sum all rule evaluations across all trades
- Trade 1: 5 rules evaluated, 4 passed, 1 violated
- Trade 2: 5 rules evaluated, 5 passed, 0 violated
- Trade 3: 4 rules evaluated (1 skipped due to missing data), 3 passed, 1 violated
- Total: 14 rules evaluated, 12 passed, 2 violated


**Step 2**: Calculate percentage
```
Adherence = 12 / 14 × 100 = 85.7%
```


**Severity Weighting** (if enabled):


**Step 1**: Multiply passes/violations by rule weight
- Trade 1: Daily loss rule (weight 3) passed = 3 points
- Trade 1: Time window rule (weight 2) violated = -2 points (violation reduces weighted score)
- Trade 2: All 5 rules passed (weights: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1) = 9 points
- Total weighted passes: 20 points out of 24 possible


**Step 2**: Calculate weighted percentage
```
Weighted Adherence = 20 / 24 × 100 = 83.3%
```


**Note**: Weighted adherence typically lower than unweighted if high-severity rules are violated.


**What this panel shows**: At-a-glance compliance status. First thing you see when reviewing rules.


### 2. Rule-Level Breakdown Table


**Location**: Middle of dashboard, sortable table


**Columns**:
1. **Rule Name**: Human-readable rule label (e.g., "Max 3 trades per day")
2. **Type**: Rule category (Time & Session, Risk & Loss, Behavior, etc.)
3. **Evaluated**: How many times rule was checked
4. **Passed**: Count of passes
5. **Violated**: Count of violations
6. **Adherence %**: Pass percentage
7. **Recent Trend**: Arrow (up/down/flat) comparing recent to all-time
8. **Status**: Stable / Deteriorating / Improving / Unstable


**Example Table**:


| Rule Name | Type | Evaluated | Passed | Violated | Adherence | Trend | Status |
|-----------|------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Max 3 trades/day | Trade Count | 40 | 36 | 4 | 90% | ↓ | Deteriorating |
| Time window 8-12 | Time & Session | 60 | 52 | 8 | 87% | → | Stable |
| Min 2:1 R:R | Risk & Loss | 60 | 54 | 6 | 90% | ↑ | Improving |
| No trade after 3 losses | Behavior | 12 | 9 | 3 | 75% | ↓ | Deteriorating |
| Only approved tags | Tag Compliance | 60 | 57 | 3 | 95% | → | Stable |


**Sorting Options**:
- By adherence (lowest first): Shows weakest rules
- By violations (highest first): Shows most frequently broken rules
- By recent trend (deteriorating first): Shows where discipline is slipping
- By evaluation count (highest first): Shows most relevant rules (evaluated often)


**Clicking a rule**: Opens detailed view showing:
- All trades where rule was evaluated
- Violation context (time of day, emotion tags, trade outcome)
- Violation timeline
- Link to trades for review


**What this table shows**: Granular rule-by-rule compliance. Identifies which specific rules need attention.


### 3. Violation Timeline


**Location**: Bottom half of dashboard, chronological visualization


**Display Format**: Timeline with markers for each violation


**Example**:
```
Week 1:  ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓   (clean week, 7 trades, 0 violations)
Week 2:  ✓ ✓ ✗ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✗   (2 violations)
Week 3:  ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓   (clean week)
Week 4:  ✗ ✗ ✗ ✓ ✗ ✓ ✗   (5 violations - CLUSTER)
```


**Violation markers show**:
- Rule name (hover to see which rule)
- Violation reason (hover for details)
- Trade outcome (win/loss, P&L)
- Emotion tags (if violation correlates with specific emotions)


**Clustering Detection**:
When 3+ violations occur within 5 trades or 2 days, dashboard highlights:
> "Violation cascade detected: 5 violations in 7 trades from [date] to [date]"


**What clustering reveals**:
- Emotional breakdown periods (after losses, during drawdowns)
- Discipline collapse after long sessions
- Revenge trading episodes
- Tilting patterns


**Contextual Filtering**:
- Filter by rule type (show only "Max trades/day" violations)
- Filter by time of day (show only afternoon violations)
- Filter by emotion (show only violations with "FOMO" or "Revenge" entry emotion)
- Filter by outcome (show only violations that also lost money)


**What this timeline shows**: When violations occur, whether they cluster, and what conditions surround them.


### 4. Trend Line Analysis


**Location**: Right side of dashboard or below timeline, graph format


**Display**: Line chart showing adherence percentage over time


**X-axis**: Time (days, weeks, or trade count)


**Y-axis**: Adherence percentage (0-100%)


**Multiple Lines**:
- **Global adherence**: Overall compliance across all rules
- **Rule-specific adherence**: Selectable (e.g., show only "Max trades/day" adherence over time)


**Trend Indicators**:
- **Upward trend**: Adherence improving over time
- **Downward trend**: Adherence declining over time
- **Flat trend**: Stable adherence
- **Volatile trend**: Adherence fluctuates (unstable discipline)


**Example Graph**:
```
100% ┤                              ╭─╮
 90% ┤    ╭───╮                ╭───╯ │
 80% ┤  ╭─╯   ╰─╮            ╭─╯     │
 70% ┤ ╭╯       ╰───╮     ╭──╯       │
 60% ┼─╯             ╰─────╯         │
     └─────────────────────────────────
      W1  W2  W3  W4  W5  W6  W7  W8
```


**Interpretation**:
- Weeks 1-3: Low adherence (60-75%), improving
- Weeks 4-5: Adherence dropped to 60% (relapse)
- Weeks 6-8: Adherence recovered to 90% (discipline restoration)


**Rolling Averages**:
- 7-day rolling average: Smooths daily volatility
- 30-day rolling average: Shows longer-term trends


**Comparison Mode**:
- Overlay multiple rules on same graph
- Example: "Max trades/day" vs "Time window" adherence over time
- Reveals whether all rules deteriorate together or independently


**What this trend line shows**: Long-term trajectory of discipline. Detects improvement, decay, or recovery periods.

## How Tags Affect the Dashboard


Tags integrate with the Rules vs Reality Dashboard to enable strategy-specific and context-specific violation analysis.


### Tag-Based Rule Applicability


Rules can be scoped to apply only to trades with specific tags:


**Example Rule**:
- Rule: "Max 5 trades per day"
- Applies to: Trades tagged "scalp" only
- Does NOT apply to: Trades tagged "swing" or other tags


**Dashboard Impact**:
- Rule is evaluated only for scalp-tagged trades
- Violation count reflects only scalp trades
- Adherence percentage calculated using only scalp trade denominator


**Dashboard Display**:
```
Rule: Max 5 scalp trades per day
Evaluated: 22 days (days with at least 1 scalp trade)
Passed: 20 days
Violated: 2 days
Adherence: 91%
```


**Without tag scoping**, this rule would evaluate all 40 trading days (including days with 0 scalp trades), distorting adherence calculation.


### Tag-Based Violation Clustering


Dashboard shows which tags correlate with violations:


**Example Analysis**:
> "Your 'Max 3 trades per day' rule was violated 8 times. Of these 8 violations, 7 occurred on days when 'breakout' tag appeared 3+ times. Pattern: Breakout setups lead to overtrading."


**Tag Cluster Report** (in dashboard):


| Tag | Violations | % of Total Violations |
|-----|------------|----------------------|
| breakout | 7 | 87% |
| scalp | 1 | 13% |
| swing | 0 | 0% |


**What it shows**: Which strategies or setups are associated with rule-breaking. Identifies high-risk contexts.


### Tag-Based Contextual Grouping


Dashboard groups violations by tag context to reveal patterns:


**Example**:
- Rule: "Allowed time window: 8 AM - 12 PM"
- Violations: 8 total
- Tag breakdown:
  - 6 violations: trades tagged "revenge" or "FOMO"
  - 2 violations: trades tagged "A+ setup"


**Dashboard Display**:
> "Time window violations: 8 total. 75% (6 out of 8) had emotion-driven tags ('revenge', 'FOMO'). 25% had quality tags. Pattern: Time window violations correlate with impulsive trades, not setup-driven trades."


**What it shows**: Whether violations are strategic (trading outside window for good setups) vs emotional (trading outside window due to FOMO/revenge).


### Tag-Based Adherence Scoring


If rules use tag scoping, global adherence score reflects only applicable trades:


**Example Scenario**:
- Total trades: 60
- Rule A: "Max 5 scalp trades/day" (applies to 22 scalp trades)
- Rule B: "Min 2:1 R:R" (applies to all 60 trades)
- Rule C: "Only trade 'approved' tags" (applies to all 60 trades)


**Total Evaluations**:
- Scalp trades: Rule A + Rule B + Rule C = 3 evaluations per scalp trade (22 × 3 = 66)
- Non-scalp trades: Rule B + Rule C only = 2 evaluations per trade (38 × 2 = 76)
- Total: 142 evaluations


**Global Adherence**:
- Passed: 128 / 142 = 90%


**Without tag scoping**, Rule A would evaluate all 60 trades (40 days), artificially inflating evaluation count and distorting adherence.


### Tag Weighting (Optional)


Some organizations assign severity weights based on tags:


**Example**:
- Violations on "challenge-account" tagged trades: Weight × 2 (higher stakes)
- Violations on "funded-account" tagged trades: Weight × 3 (highest stakes)
- Violations on "demo-account" tagged trades: Weight × 1 (lower stakes)


**Dashboard Impact**:
- Weighted adherence score reflects violation severity based on account context
- Challenge and funded violations penalize global adherence more than demo violations


**Note**: This is advanced configuration, not enabled by default.


![Tags and Dashboard](/img/tags-dashboard-integration.png)


## How Time Windows Affect Dashboard


The dashboard respects time-scoped filters (same as Time-Scoped Analytics):


### Time Window Options


- **Last 10 trades**: Most recent 10 closed trades
- **Last 20 trades**: Most recent 20 closed trades
- **Last 7 days**: All trades from past week
- **Last 30 days**: All trades from past month
- **All Time**: Complete history


### Dashboard Recalculation


When you change time window, ALL dashboard metrics recalculate:


**Adherence Score**: Uses only trades within window


**Example**:
- All Time: 87% adherence (261 passed / 300 evaluated)
- Last 30 Days: 78% adherence (78 passed / 100 evaluated)


**Rule-Level Breakdown**: Recalculates per-rule adherence


**Example**:
- Rule: "Max 3 trades/day"
- All Time: 90% adherence (36 passed / 40 days)
- Last 30 Days: 75% adherence (24 passed / 32 days) → Recent deterioration


**Violation Timeline**: Shows only violations within window


**Trend Line**: Displays trend within selected window


### Revealing Recent Behavioral Change


Time windows reveal whether discipline is improving or declining:


**Scenario 1: Recent Improvement**


**All Time Metrics**:
- Global adherence: 68%
- "Max trades/day" adherence: 62%
- "Time window" adherence: 71%


**Last 30 Days Metrics**:
- Global adherence: 82%
- "Max trades/day" adherence: 85%
- "Time window" adherence: 88%


**Pattern Detected**: Adherence improved across all rules in recent month. Discipline recovery.


**Scenario 2: Recent Decline**


**All Time Metrics**:
- Global adherence: 85%
- "No trading after 3 losses" adherence: 81%


**Last 20 Trades Metrics**:
- Global adherence: 72%
- "No trading after 3 losses" adherence: 58%


**Pattern Detected**: Recent adherence declined significantly. Discipline decay, possibly due to recent losing streak or emotional pressure.


**Scenario 3: Stable Consistency**


**All Time Metrics**:
- Global adherence: 88%


**Last 30 Days Metrics**:
- Global adherence: 87%


**Pattern Detected**: No significant change. Consistent discipline.


### Dashboard Indicators for Time-Based Patterns


**Recent vs All-Time Comparison** (displayed prominently):


```
Global Adherence: 78%
Recent (Last 20): 68% ↓ (10% decline)
```


**Color Coding**:
- Red: Recent < All-Time by >10% (deteriorating)
- Blue: Recent > All-Time by >10% (improving)
- Green: Recent within ±5% of All-Time (stable)
- Yellow: Recent varies >15% (unstable)


**Trend Arrow**:
- ↓: Declining adherence
- ↑: Improving adherence
- →: Stable adherence
- ↕: Volatile adherence


**What time windows enable**: Detection of recent changes that all-time data obscures. Critical for identifying discipline relapse before significant damage occurs.


![Time Windows Dashboard](/img/time-windows-dashboard.png)


## How the Dashboard Supports Behavior Discovery


The dashboard's longitudinal view reveals behavioral patterns that single-trade analysis cannot:


### Pattern 1: Overtrading After Wins


**Dashboard Evidence**:
> "Your 'Max 3 trades/day' rule was violated 8 times. Violation timeline shows 7 out of 8 occurred on days when your first trade was a win. Days starting with losses: 2% violation rate. Days starting with wins: 28% violation rate."


**What it reveals**: Overconfidence after wins leads to overtrading. Winning first trade triggers increased risk-taking.


**Discovery method**: Violation timeline + trade outcome correlation


### Pattern 2: Time-of-Day Breakdown


**Dashboard Evidence**:
> "Your 'Allowed time window 8-12 PM' rule: 12 violations total. Session breakdown: 0 violations before 2 PM. 12 violations between 2 PM - 6 PM. Pattern: All time window violations occur in afternoon, none in morning."


**What it reveals**: Afternoon discipline collapses. Morning discipline stable.


**Discovery method**: Violation timeline + time-of-day filtering


### Pattern 3: Violations After Emotional Spikes


**Dashboard Evidence**:
> "Your 'No trading after 3 losses' rule: 5 violations. Tag analysis: 4 out of 5 violations had 'Revenge' or 'FOMO' entry emotion on the 4th trade. 1 violation had 'Confident' entry (anomaly). Pattern: Emotional entry emotions predict rule violations."


**What it reveals**: Revenge/FOMO emotions correlate with discipline breakdown.


**Discovery method**: Violation timeline + emotion tag filtering


### Pattern 4: Setup-Specific Breakdown


**Dashboard Evidence**:
> "Your 'Min 2:1 R:R ratio' rule: 90% adherence overall. Tag breakdown: 'Scalp' trades: 72% adherence. 'Swing' trades: 98% adherence. 'Breakout' trades: 88% adherence. Pattern: Scalp setups consistently violate R:R rule (lower R:R tolerance)."


**What it reveals**: Strategy-specific discipline variance. Scalping tempts you to take sub-2:1 R:R trades.


**Discovery method**: Rule-level breakdown + tag clustering


### Pattern 5: Discipline Lapse Sequences (Violation Cascades)


**Dashboard Evidence**:
> "Violation cascade detected: 7 violations across 5 trades from Nov 12-14. Rules violated: Max trades (3×), Max daily loss (2×), Time window (1×), No trade after losses (1×). All 5 trades lost money. Total cascade cost: -$1,240."


**What it reveals**: Emotional breakdown episodes where multiple rules are violated in rapid succession. Tilting behavior.


**Discovery method**: Violation timeline + clustering detection + outcome correlation


### Pattern 6: Chronic vs Situational Breakdown


**Dashboard Evidence**:
> "Your 'Max 3 trades/day' rule: 52% adherence (chronic failure). Violations spread across 12 weeks. No significant recent improvement. Pattern: Structural overtrading issue, not situational."


vs


> "Your 'No trading after 3 losses' rule: 83% adherence (acute failure). 2 violations, both during Week 4 (losing streak week). All other weeks: 100% adherence. Pattern: Situational breakdown under pressure."


**What it reveals**: Whether discipline issues are systemic (chronic, require rule adjustment or strategy change) vs episodic (acute, require emotional management during specific conditions).


**Discovery method**: Rule-level adherence + violation timeline + chronic/acute classification


### Clinical Interpretation (Mirror Language)


Dashboard discoveries use descriptive language, not coaching:


**Clinical (Correct)**:
> "90% of your 'Max trades/day' violations occur on days when your first trade wins. Days starting with wins: 28% violation rate. Days starting with losses: 2% violation rate."


**NOT Coaching (Incorrect)**:
> "You get overconfident after winning trades and take too many trades. You need to stick to your limits even when winning."


**Clinical (Correct)**:
> "Your adherence to 'Time window 8-12' rule declined from 88% (all-time) to 62% (last 30 days). All recent violations occurred after 2 PM. 75% of afternoon violations had 'Impatience' or 'FOMO' entry tags."


**NOT Coaching (Incorrect)**:
> "Your afternoon discipline is falling apart. Stop trading after lunch or you'll keep breaking your rules."


The dashboard shows the pattern. You decide what it means and what (if anything) to do about it.

## Examples of Meaningful Insights


These examples show clinical, factual insights the dashboard provides:


### Insight 1: Post-Loss Overtrading


**Dashboard Display**:
> "Rule: Max 3 trades per day
> Adherence: 78% (31 passed / 40 days)
> Violations: 9 days
> Pattern: 8 out of 9 violations occurred on days when your first trade was a loss. Days starting with losses: 40% violation rate (8 violations / 20 days). Days starting with wins: 5% violation rate (1 violation / 20 days). Violation days averaged 5.2 trades. Compliant days averaged 2.4 trades."


### Insight 2: Adherence Deterioration Trend


**Dashboard Display**:
> "Global Adherence:
> All Time: 85%
> Last 60 Days: 88% (improving)
> Last 30 Days: 78% (declined 10% from 60-day)
> Last 10 Trades: 72% (declined further)
> Pattern: Adherence peaked 30-60 days ago, has declined 16% since. Trend line shows consistent decline over past 4 weeks. Recent violations cluster in last 2 weeks."


### Insight 3: London Session Rule Violations


**Dashboard Display**:
> "Rule: London session only (2-6 AM EST)
> Adherence: 85% (51 passed / 60 trades)
> Violations: 9 trades
> Violation breakdown:
> - 7 violations: Trades entered 2-6 PM EST (afternoon)
> - 2 violations: Trades entered 7-8 AM EST (post-London)
> Tags on violation trades: 'FOMO' (6 trades), 'breakout' (4 trades), 'revenge' (3 trades)
> Pattern: Afternoon FOMO entries account for 78% of London-only rule violations."


### Insight 4: Multiple-Rule Violation Days


**Dashboard Display**:
> "Violation cascade days: 4 total (10% of trading days)
> Cascade definition: 3+ rule violations in single day
> Day 1 (Nov 8): 4 violations (Max trades, Time window, R:R, No trade after losses)
> Day 2 (Nov 14): 3 violations (Max trades, Max daily loss, Position size)
> Day 3 (Nov 21): 5 violations (Max trades ×2, Time window, R:R, Daily loss)
> Day 4 (Nov 28): 3 violations (Time window, Max trades, No trade after losses)
> Cascade days: 15 total violations (38% of all violations). Average P&L on cascade days: -$420."


### Insight 5: Rule-Specific Improvement


**Dashboard Display**:
> "Rule: Min 2:1 R:R ratio
> All Time Adherence: 74% (44 passed / 60 trades)
> Last 20 Trades Adherence: 85% (17 passed / 20 trades)
> Improvement: +11%
> Pattern: R:R adherence improved in recent trades. Violations declined from 26% to 15%. Last violation occurred 8 trades ago. Trend line shows consistent improvement over past month."


### Insight 6: Tag-Correlated Violations


**Dashboard Display**:
> "Rule: Only approved setup tags ('breakout', 'pullback', 'range')
> Adherence: 92% (55 passed / 60 trades)
> Violations: 5 trades
> Unapproved tags used: 'reversal' (3 trades), 'counter-trend' (2 trades)
> Outcome on violation trades: 1 win, 4 losses. Win rate: 20%.
> Outcome on compliant trades: 35 wins, 20 losses. Win rate: 64%.
> Pattern: Unapproved tag usage correlates with poor outcomes (20% vs 64% win rate)."


### Insight 7: Chronic Overtrading Baseline


**Dashboard Display**:
> "Rule: Max 5 trades per day
> Adherence: 42% (17 passed / 40 days)
> Violations: 23 days (58% of trading days)
> Violation frequency: Consistent across all weeks (no clustering)
> Average trades on violation days: 7.2
> Pattern: Chronic overtrading. Rule violated more often than followed. No recent improvement (Last 30 days: 38% adherence, worse than all-time). This rule is structurally ignored, not situationally violated."

## Limitations and Edge Cases


The dashboard has several limitations and handles edge cases in specific ways:


### Conditional Rules and Applicability


**Issue**: Some rules only apply under certain conditions (tag-scoped, context-dependent).


**Example**:
- Rule: "No trading after 3 consecutive losses"
- Only evaluates when 3 consecutive losses have occurred
- If you have a 10-win streak, rule is never evaluated


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Rule shows "Evaluated: 8 times" (only days with 3 prior losses)
- Adherence calculated only from those 8 evaluations
- Dashboard notes: "Conditional rule: Only evaluated after 3 consecutive losses"


**Limitation**: Low evaluation count makes adherence percentage less stable. 2 violations out of 8 evaluations = 75% adherence, but 2 violations out of 50 evaluations = 96% adherence.


### Partially Satisfied Rules


**Issue**: Some rules have multi-stage evaluation (entry and exit).


**Example**:
- Rule: "Allowed time window: 8 AM - 12 PM"
- Trade entered at 11:00 AM (compliant)
- Trade closed at 1:00 PM (outside window)


**Dashboard Handling**:
- By default, rules evaluate at entry only
- If rule specifies exit-time evaluation, violation flagged at exit
- Dashboard shows: "Time window rule: Entry compliant, Exit violated"


**Limitation**: Rules evaluated at multiple points may show ambiguous adherence (passed at entry, violated at exit = overall violation).


### Missing Data Prevents Evaluation


**Issue**: Rules requiring specific fields cannot evaluate if data is missing.


**Example**:
- Rule: "Min 2:1 R:R ratio"
- Requires: Entry price, stop loss, take profit
- Trade logged without stop loss or take profit


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Rule evaluation status: "SKIPPED_MISSING_DATA"
- Not counted as pass or violation
- Dashboard shows: "Evaluated: 55 / 60 trades (5 skipped due to missing SL/TP)"


**Limitation**: Inconsistent data logging reduces evaluation count, making adherence less meaningful. If 30 of 60 trades skip evaluation, adherence based on only 30 trades.


### Inactive or Deleted Rules


**Issue**: Rules can be deactivated or deleted. Historical data remains.


**Scenario 1: Inactive Rule**
- Rule exists but is deactivated
- Historical evaluations remain in database
- Dashboard shows rule but marks it "Inactive"
- Historical adherence still calculated ("All Time: 78%")
- Recent adherence shows "N/A - Rule inactive"


**Scenario 2: Deleted Rule**
- Rule is permanently deleted
- Historical violations remain linked to trades
- Dashboard shows "Deleted Rule #12345" with historical adherence
- Recent adherence shows "N/A - Rule deleted"


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Inactive rules: Displayed in separate "Inactive Rules" section
- Deleted rules: Displayed only if "Show historical rules" toggle is enabled
- Global adherence score: Excludes inactive/deleted rules by default


**Limitation**: Comparing historical vs recent adherence is complicated if rules were active historically but inactive recently.


### Trades Imported Without Complete Metadata


**Issue**: CSV imports may lack emotion, conviction, or tag data.


**Example**:
- Import 100 trades from broker CSV
- Financial data complete (entry, exit, P&L)
- Psychology data missing (no emotions, conviction, adherence)
- Tags missing


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Financial rules (max trades, time window, R:R, daily loss) evaluate normally
- Behavioral rules (e.g., "Required tag: 'setup-confirmed'") skip evaluation due to missing tags
- Global adherence calculated using only rules that could evaluate


**Dashboard Display**:
```
Global Adherence: 88%
Note: 40 out of 60 trades imported without psychology data. Behavioral rules skipped on these trades.
```


**Limitation**: Imported trades without full data reduce behavioral rule evaluation count, potentially inflating adherence (only compliant trades have data to evaluate).


### Adherence Recalculation After Retroactive Changes


**Issue**: Rules can be edited or trades can be updated retroactively.


**Scenario 1: Rule Threshold Changed**
- Original rule: "Max 3 trades per day"
- Change to: "Max 5 trades per day"
- Retroactive recalculation: Days with 4 trades were violations, now compliant


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Recalculates all historical evaluations using new rule definition
- Adherence score updates immediately
- Violation timeline updates (violations removed or added based on new threshold)


**Dashboard Display**:
```
Rule: Max 5 trades per day (updated from 3)
Adherence: 92% (37 passed / 40 days)
Note: Rule threshold changed on Dec 1. Adherence recalculated retroactively.
```


**Scenario 2: Trade Data Updated**
- Trade originally logged without stop loss
- Stop loss added later (retroactive edit)
- R:R rule can now evaluate (previously skipped)


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Rule evaluation re-runs for that trade
- If trade now passes, adherence improves
- If trade now violates, adherence declines


**Limitation**: Retroactive rule changes can dramatically alter historical adherence, making before/after comparisons confusing.


### Multi-Account Rules and Aggregation


**Issue**: Rules can apply to specific accounts or all accounts.


**Example**:
- Rule A: "Max $500 daily loss" on Challenge Account 1
- Rule B: "Max $2,000 daily loss" on Funded Account
- Global adherence aggregates both


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Account filter: Select specific account to view adherence for that account only
- Without filter: Adherence aggregates across all accounts


**Dashboard Display**:
```
Global Adherence: 85% (all accounts)


Filter by Account:
- Challenge Account 1: 78% adherence
- Funded Account: 92% adherence
```


**Limitation**: Aggregating adherence across accounts with different rule sets can obscure account-specific issues.


### Time Zone Handling for Time-Based Rules


**Issue**: Time window rules use configured timezone. If timezone is wrong, violations may be incorrectly flagged.


**Example**:
- Rule: "Allowed time window: 8 AM - 12 PM EST"
- User timezone set to UTC (incorrect)
- Trade entered at 10 AM EST (should pass)
- System interprets as 3 PM UTC (outside 8 AM - 12 PM UTC window) → Violation


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Uses timezone from settings for all time-based rule evaluations
- If timezone changes, historical evaluations do NOT recalculate (timestamp is absolute)


**Dashboard Display**:
```
Rule: Allowed time window 8-12
Adherence: 72%
Note: Ensure timezone in settings matches your trading timezone. Incorrect timezone causes false violations.
```


**Limitation**: Retroactive timezone fixes do not correct historical violations. Time-based adherence may be permanently inaccurate if timezone was wrong during logging.


### Rules with External Dependencies (News Events)


**Issue**: News-based rules depend on economic calendar data.


**Example**:
- Rule: "No trading 30 minutes before high-impact news"
- If economic calendar is incomplete or outdated, rule may not evaluate correctly


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Rule status shows "CALENDAR_DEPENDENCY"
- If calendar data is missing for a trade's timestamp, rule skips evaluation
- Dashboard shows: "Evaluated: 55 / 60 trades (5 skipped due to missing calendar data)"


**Limitation**: News-based rule adherence is only as accurate as economic calendar data completeness.


### Deleted Trades and Adherence Impact


**Issue**: If a trade is deleted, its rule evaluations are removed.


**Scenario**:
- 60 trades logged, 300 rule evaluations, 261 passed → 87% adherence
- Delete 5 trades (all had violations)
- 55 trades remain, 275 evaluations, 261 passed → 95% adherence


**Dashboard Handling**:
- Adherence recalculates immediately when trade is deleted
- Violation timeline updates (deleted trades removed)


**Dashboard Display**:
```
Global Adherence: 95%
Note: 5 trades deleted on Dec 5. Adherence recalculated.
```


**Limitation**: Selective deletion of losing or violating trades can artificially inflate adherence. Dashboard notes deletion events but cannot prevent gaming.


## Summary


The Rules vs Reality Dashboard is a behavioral truth instrument that shows whether you follow your self-imposed rules. It provides:


- Global and rule-level adherence scores
- Violation timelines with clustering detection
- Trend analysis showing improvement or decay
- Tag-based contextual analysis
- Time-windowed comparisons


The dashboard does not judge or prescribe. It mirrors your compliance data and reveals patterns. You decide what those patterns mean and how to respond.
