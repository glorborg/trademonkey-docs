# Threads (Life of a Trade)

## Purpose

Threads show the full chronological story of a single trade — from planning and entry, through execution, to post-trade reflection. They are designed to help you understand what actually happened inside one trade, including how your psychology evolved over time.

## What Threads Show

Each thread is a timeline of events for one trade, typically including:

- **Entry events**
  - Symbol, side, entry price, size, account
  - Entry emotions and conviction
  - Entry plan adherence
  - Entry notes and screenshots

- **Mid-trade events**
  - Notes you add while the trade is open
  - Rule checks and violations from your rules engine
  - Additional screenshots and observations
  - Signs of psychological shifts (e.g., doubt, FOMO, frustration)

- **Exit events**
  - Exit time, price, and P&L
  - Exit emotions and conviction
  - Exit plan adherence (did you follow your plan?)
  - Exit notes and screenshots

- **Post-trade events**
  - Reflections added minutes, hours, or days later
  - Optional AI-generated summaries and deeper analyses

**Threads vs Execution Recap**

- **Execution Recap**: Multi-trade feed for scanning patterns across many trades.
- **Threads**: Deep narrative for one trade to see exactly how it unfolded.

## How to Use Threads

1. **Open a thread**
   - From your trade list, Execution Recap, or Trade Recap, open a specific trade and switch to its thread view.

2. **Read the timeline top to bottom**
   - Start from the first entry event and scroll down through each moment in order.
   - Pay attention to timestamps to see when key decisions and shifts happened.

3. **Check the entry**
   - Confirm the setup: entry price, SL/TP, conviction, emotions, and whether you followed your plan.
   - Review any entry screenshot and notes to see what you saw and why you pulled the trigger.

4. **Review mid-trade behavior**
   - Read mid-trade notes to see how your thinking changed while the trade was open.
   - Look at any rule violations in context (what was happening when you broke a rule).
   - Use screenshots to compare the chart at different points in the trade.

5. **Understand the exit**
   - Check why you closed: hit stop, hit target, breakeven, or discretionary exit.
   - Compare planned vs actual exit levels and plan adherence.
   - Review exit emotions and conviction to see if confidence held or collapsed.

6. **Add post-trade reflections**
   - After the trade, add a reflection capturing lessons learned and patterns you notice.
   - You can add more reflections later during end-of-day or weekly review.

7. **Optionally use AI analysis**
   - For important trades (big wins/losses, emotional trades, rule violations), run an AI summary or deep-dive.
   - AI will use the full thread (events, emotions, notes, screenshots) to surface patterns and behavioral signals.
   - AI usage may be subject to limits based on your subscription level; see the pricing page for details.

8. **Use threads in your review routines**
   - **End of day**: Open threads for today’s most important trades and skim through their stories.
   - **End of week**: Use Execution Recap to find outliers and then read those trades’ threads in detail.
   - **Pre-session**: Revisit the thread for your last trade (especially a big loss or emotional trade) before you start trading again.

## When Threads Are Most Useful

- Reviewing your biggest win or loss of the day or week  
- Investigating a specific rule violation and what led to it  
- Understanding why conviction collapsed or emotions spiked on a trade  
- Preparing questions for deeper analysis or AI Deep Dive  
- Building more accurate self-awareness about your execution habits

## Important Notes

- Threads are **chronological and append-focused**: events are timestamped so you can see the real sequence. Notes, reflections, and screenshots can be updated; core event timing and rule logs are preserved for accuracy.
- Threads are **private to you**. Any future accountability or sharing features would be strictly opt-in and under your control.
- The quality of a thread depends on what you log. Emotions, conviction, notes, and screenshots make the narrative far more useful than bare P&L.
- Threads do **not** replace multi-trade views. Use Execution Recap, analytics, and psychology dashboards to see patterns across trades, then use threads to understand individual trades in depth.
- Core journaling, rules, and analytics continue to work even if you choose not to use AI features.
