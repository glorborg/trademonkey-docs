# AI Deep Dive Explorer


## What AI Deep Dive Explorer Is


AI Deep Dive Explorer is a conversational pattern analysis tool that allows you to explore specific behavioral patterns through multi-level questioning. Unlike AI Diagnostics (which scans all data for patterns), Deep Dive focuses on one pattern at a time and investigates it through iterative follow-up questions.


This is Perplexity-style exploration: you ask a question, AI answers using your data, you ask a follow-up question to go deeper, AI refines its analysis, repeat up to 5 levels deep.


Deep Dive Explorer answers: "Why does this pattern occur? When is it strongest? What conditions amplify or reduce it?"


## Purpose and Role


Deep Dive Explorer serves as a behavioral microscope. After identifying a pattern (through AI Diagnostics, Time-Scoped Analytics, or Execution Recap), you use Deep Dive to:


- **Understand causality**: Why does conviction drop during trades?
- **Identify conditions**: When does FOMO emotion lead to losses vs breakeven?
- **Detect amplifiers**: What makes afternoon discipline worse (time alone? or time + losses + specific setups)?
- **Explore multi-dimensional patterns**: Do low-conviction + FOMO + afternoon trades perform worse than any single factor alone?


Deep Dive provides depth on a single topic. It does not scan all your data for patterns—that's AI Diagnostics' role. It digs into one pattern you already identified.


### Deep Dive vs Other AI Features


**AI Deep Dive Explorer (Depth)**
- **Purpose**: Explore one specific pattern through multi-level questioning
- **Interaction**: Conversational Q&A (up to 5 levels deep)
- **Output**: Sequential answers that build on previous context
- **Breadth**: Narrow (one pattern at a time)
- **Depth**: Deep (explores causality, conditions, amplifiers, context)
- **Use case**: "Why does X happen? When is X strongest? What conditions cause X?"


**AI Diagnostics (Breadth)**
- **Purpose**: Identify all significant patterns in your data
- **Interaction**: Single request → Report
- **Output**: Structured summary with 5-10 key findings
- **Breadth**: Wide (scans all dimensions)
- **Depth**: Shallow (each finding is 2-3 sentences)
- **Use case**: "What patterns exist in my data?"


**Trade Thread Summary (Narrative)**
- **Purpose**: Explain what happened in one specific trade
- **Interaction**: Single request → Trade timeline analysis
- **Output**: Chronological narrative of one trade's execution
- **Breadth**: Narrow (one trade)
- **Depth**: Medium (trade-specific context)
- **Use case**: "What happened during this losing trade?"


**Rules Coach (Configuration)**
- **Purpose**: Help define or explain trading rules
- **Interaction**: Guided wizard or Q&A
- **Output**: Rule proposals or violation explanations
- **Breadth**: N/A (not pattern detection)
- **Depth**: N/A (not analysis, just configuration)
- **Use case**: "Help me create rules from my strategy"


### Typical Workflow


1. **Identify pattern** (AI Diagnostics, Time-Scoped Analytics, or Execution Recap):
   > "Conviction drops 4.2 points from entry to exit on losing trades"


2. **Open Deep Dive Explorer** and ask initial question:
   > "Why does my conviction drop so much on losing trades?"


3. **AI answers** using your data:
   > "Conviction drops occur most often when price pulls back 10+ pips from entry. Of 18 conviction-drop trades, 16 had pullbacks exceeding 10 pips before hitting stop or target."


4. **Ask follow-up** to go deeper:
   > "Does this happen more at certain times of day?"


5. **AI refines** analysis:
   > "Yes. Afternoon trades (after 2 PM) show conviction drops 2.3x more frequently than morning trades. Afternoon pullback tolerance appears lower."


6. **Continue drilling** up to 5 levels total:
   > "What emotions correlate with these afternoon conviction drops?"
   > AI: "85% of afternoon conviction-drop trades had 'Impatience' or 'FOMO' tagged at entry..."


7. **Session ends** after 5 questions or when you close it


8. **Use insights** to adjust rules, strategy, or behavior

## Five-Level Depth Limit and Follow-Up System


Deep Dive Explorer allows up to 5 question-answer turns per exploration session. This creates a structured drilling process:


### Level Structure


**Level 1 (Initial Question)**
- You ask broad question about a pattern
- AI analyzes your complete trade data
- AI provides initial answer with supporting evidence


**Level 2 (First Follow-Up)**
- You refine or redirect based on Level 1 answer
- AI narrows focus to specific sub-pattern
- AI provides more targeted answer


**Level 3 (Second Follow-Up)**
- You drill into conditions or context
- AI isolates specific scenarios or combinations
- AI provides conditional analysis


**Level 4 (Third Follow-Up)**
- You explore amplifiers or edge cases
- AI identifies what makes pattern stronger/weaker
- AI provides comparative analysis


**Level 5 (Final Follow-Up)**
- You clarify remaining questions or validate hypothesis
- AI provides final contextual details
- AI may summarize pattern's key factors


**Session End**: After Level 5, session closes. You can start a new session (consumes another credit) if more exploration needed.


### Example 5-Level Exploration


**Level 1 Question**:
> "Why does my conviction drop between entry and exit?"


**Level 1 Answer**:
> "Your conviction drops an average of 3.8 points from entry to exit across 42 trades with negative conviction gaps. Drops occur most frequently (78%) when trades move against you initially, even if they later recover. Only 22% of conviction drops occur on trades that never go negative."


**Level 2 Question**:
> "How much initial drawdown triggers conviction loss?"


**Level 2 Answer**:
> "Conviction drops by 3+ points when trades go 15+ pips negative from entry. Of 28 trades with 15+ pip drawdowns, 24 (86%) showed conviction drops. Smaller drawdowns (5-10 pips) correlate with conviction drops only 35% of the time. Pattern: Your conviction is sensitive to mid-level drawdowns (15-25 pips), not minor noise."


**Level 3 Question**:
> "Does this pattern differ by time of day?"


**Level 3 Answer**:
> "Yes. Morning trades (before 12 PM) maintain conviction despite 15+ pip drawdowns 42% of the time. Afternoon trades (after 2 PM) maintain conviction only 12% of the time under same drawdown conditions. Afternoon conviction is 3.5x more fragile than morning conviction when facing drawdowns."


**Level 4 Question**:
> "What emotions appear when afternoon conviction drops?"


**Level 4 Answer**:
> "In afternoon trades with conviction drops during drawdowns, 82% had 'Impatience' or 'Fear' tagged at entry. Morning trades with similar drawdowns but stable conviction had 'Calm' or 'Confident' at entry 76% of the time. Pattern: Entry emotion predicts conviction resilience under drawdown stress."


**Level 5 Question**:
> "Do afternoon trades with calm/confident entry maintain conviction better?"


**Level 5 Answer**:
> "Partially. Afternoon trades with 'Calm' or 'Confident' entry maintain conviction 58% of the time under 15+ pip drawdowns (vs 12% overall afternoon rate). However, this is still below morning rate (42%). Pattern: Afternoon timing weakens conviction resilience even with positive entry emotions, but positive emotions help."


**Session End**: 5 levels reached. Key insight: Afternoon + drawdown + impatient/fearful entry = highest conviction drop risk.


### Why 5 Levels?


**Cost control**: Each question-answer pair consumes OpenAI API tokens. Limiting to 5 levels caps per-session costs.


**Cognitive load**: Beyond 5 levels, exploration becomes unfocused. Five levels force concise, targeted drilling.


**Sufficient depth**: Most patterns can be explored adequately in 3-5 levels. If more depth is needed, start a new session with refined initial question.


**Session credits**: 25 sessions per day allows multiple 5-level explorations without hitting limits.


### Follow-Up Question Guidelines


Good follow-up questions build on previous answers:


**Good Follow-Ups**:
- "Does this pattern occur more in [specific condition]?"
- "What emotions correlate with this behavior?"
- "How does this compare to [different scenario]?"
- "What percentage of [pattern] also has [other attribute]?"


**Poor Follow-Ups**:
- Unrelated topic changes ("Now tell me about my win rate" when exploring conviction gaps)
- Overly broad ("What's wrong with my trading?")
- Coaching requests ("How do I fix this?")
- Repetition of previous question without new angle


AI may refuse poor follow-ups:
> "This question changes topic. Current session is exploring conviction gaps. Please ask a follow-up related to conviction gaps, or end this session and start a new one."

## What Data Is Used


Deep Dive Explorer analyzes aggregated trade statistics and patterns, not raw individual trade details.


### Data Used (Aggregated Only)


**Performance Metrics**
- Win rate by category (emotion, conviction level, time of day, tag, etc.)
- Average P&L by category
- Trade count by category
- Percentage distributions


**Psychology Aggregates**
- Emotion frequency counts
- Average conviction scores by condition
- Conviction gap distributions
- Adherence percentages by condition


**Rule Compliance**
- Violation counts by rule
- Adherence percentages overall and per rule
- Violation timing patterns (when violations occur)


**Time-Based Patterns**
- Trade count by hour, day, session
- Performance by time window
- Duration averages


**Tag-Based Patterns**
- Performance by tag
- Tag co-occurrence (how often tags appear together)
- Tag correlation with outcomes


**Conditional Combinations**
- Multi-dimensional analysis (e.g., "FOMO + afternoon + after losses")
- Interaction effects (e.g., does morning + FOMO perform differently than afternoon + FOMO?)


### Data NOT Used


**Raw Notes and Reflections**
- Deep Dive does NOT read your free-text notes, reflections, or trade reasoning
- Rationale: Notes may contain PII (personal identifiers, account numbers, broker names)
- Notes are unstructured text that requires different AI processing (privacy risk)


**Screenshots**
- Deep Dive does NOT analyze chart screenshots
- Rationale: Image processing not implemented, privacy concerns


**Individual Trade Details**
- Deep Dive does NOT reference specific trade IDs, timestamps, or prices
- Rationale: Aggregated patterns only, not individual trade analysis (use Trade Thread Summary for that)


**External Data**
- Deep Dive does NOT know market conditions, news events, or external factors unless you mention them in your question
- Rationale: TradeMonkey only has your trade data, not market data


### Privacy and PII


Deep Dive Explorer is designed to avoid processing personally identifiable information (PII):


- **No broker names**: Questions about "FTMO" or "MyForexFunds" are fine (common knowledge), but avoid "My Account #12345 at XYZ Broker"
- **No account numbers**: Deep Dive references "Challenge Account 1" (your label), not external account IDs
- **No external identifiers**: Avoid mentioning email addresses, phone numbers, real names in questions


**AI cannot access**:
- Your email address
- Your account password
- Your billing information
- Your notes or reflections (free-text fields)


**AI can access**:
- Aggregated trade statistics
- Emotion/conviction/adherence data (structured fields)
- Tag names (if you created tags with PII, that's your responsibility—don't create tags like "john.doe@email.com")


### No Coaching or Advice


Deep Dive Explorer follows TradeMonkey's mirror philosophy: descriptive analysis only.


**AI will NOT**:
- Tell you what to do ("You should stop trading FOMO setups")
- Recommend strategies ("Try scalping instead of swing trading")
- Offer psychological advice ("Take a break after losses to reset emotionally")
- Predict future outcomes ("Your next afternoon trade will likely fail")


**AI will ONLY**:
- Describe patterns in your data ("FOMO trades have 22% win rate vs 58% for non-FOMO trades")
- Identify correlations ("Afternoon trades correlate with lower conviction")
- Quantify relationships ("85% of conviction drops occur when drawdown exceeds 15 pips")
- Compare conditions ("Morning FOMO trades perform better than afternoon FOMO trades")


If you ask a coaching question ("How do I fix my conviction drops?"), AI will reframe:
> "I can show you when conviction drops occur, what conditions amplify them, and how they correlate with outcomes. I cannot prescribe solutions. Would you like to explore conditions that correlate with stable conviction?"


## Example Exploration Paths


These examples show complete 5-level explorations following TradeMonkey's mirror philosophy.


### Exploration Path 1: Conviction Drop Investigation


**Context**: AI Diagnostics revealed "Conviction drops 4.2 points on losing trades."


**Level 1**:
> **You**: "Why does my conviction drop so much during losing trades?"
> **AI**: "Conviction drops occur most frequently when trades move into drawdown. Of 28 trades with conviction drop > 3 points, 24 (86%) went 15+ pips negative from entry before closing. Only 4 conviction-drop trades never went negative. Pattern: Drawdown triggers conviction loss."


**Level 2**:
> **You**: "How quickly does conviction drop after drawdown starts?"
> **AI**: "Based on mid-trade notes with timestamps, conviction drops occur 15-30 minutes after drawdown exceeds 15 pips. Of 12 trades with timestamped mid-trade notes, conviction had dropped by Level 2 note (avg 22 minutes after entry). Pattern: Conviction erosion is rapid, not gradual."


**Level 3**:
> **You**: "Does this pattern differ between morning and afternoon trades?"
> **AI**: "Yes. Morning trades (before 12 PM) maintain conviction longer under drawdown: Average 38 minutes before conviction drops. Afternoon trades (after 2 PM): Average 14 minutes. Afternoon conviction is 2.7x more fragile. Both still show conviction drops after 15+ pip drawdowns, but timing differs."


**Level 4**:
> **You**: "What percentage of these conviction-drop trades were closed before hitting stop loss?"
> **AI**: "82% (23 out of 28). Only 5 conviction-drop trades reached stop loss. Average exit: 8 pips before planned stop. Pattern: Conviction drop predicts premature exit. You close before stop loss when confidence collapses."


**Level 5**:
> **You**: "Do trades where I let the stop loss hit (despite conviction drops) perform better?"
> **AI**: "Small sample (only 5 trades), but 2 of 5 won (recovered after drawdown). 3 hit stop as planned. Average P&L on 'held through conviction drop' trades: -$65. Average P&L on 'closed early due to conviction drop' trades: -$88. Pattern: Holding through conviction drops slightly reduces losses, but sample too small for strong conclusions."


**Key Insight**: Conviction drops trigger premature exits 8 pips before stop, slightly worsening losses. Pattern strongest in afternoon.


### Exploration Path 2: FOMO Emotion Analysis


**Context**: Time-Scoped Analytics shows FOMO emotion appearing more frequently in recent trades.


**Level 1**:
> **You**: "When do I most commonly feel FOMO at trade entry?"
> **AI**: "FOMO entries occur most frequently after missed opportunities. Of 18 FOMO trades, 14 (78%) were entered after you observed a setup but didn't take it, then price moved, then you entered late. 4 FOMO trades had no identifiable missed-opportunity trigger. Pattern: FOMO follows hesitation."


**Level 2**:
> **You**: "How much price movement typically occurs before I enter with FOMO?"
> **AI**: "Based on entry notes mentioning price movement, FOMO entries occur after 20-40 pip moves in the intended direction. You observe setup at price X, hesitate, price moves 25 pips to X+25, then you enter (chasing). Average entry price is 28 pips from your initially identified entry level."


**Level 3**:
> **You**: "Do FOMO entries still have stop losses set, or do I skip risk management?"
> **AI**: "68% of FOMO trades have stop loss defined (12 out of 18). However, R:R ratio on FOMO trades averages 1.1:1 vs overall average of 2.3:1. Pattern: FOMO trades have stop losses, but poor risk-reward due to late entry (price closer to target, risk unchanged)."


**Level 4**:
> **You**: "How does this compare to high-conviction entries? Do they also chase price?"
> **AI**: "Trades with entry conviction 8-10 (high conviction): 8% entered after 20+ pip move. FOMO trades (conviction avg 4.1): 78% entered after 20+ pip move. Pattern: High-conviction entries occur at planned levels. FOMO entries occur after price moves away from planned levels."


**Level 5**:
> **You**: "Do FOMO trades ever recover and hit take profit despite late entry?"
> **AI**: "Rarely. 3 of 18 FOMO trades (17%) reached take profit. 11 hit stop loss (61%). 4 were closed manually before stop or target (22%). Average P&L: -$142. Pattern: Late entry reduces profit potential even when direction is correct. FOMO trades hit stop loss 3.6x more often than take profit."


**Key Insight**: FOMO is triggered by hesitation, followed by chasing 20-40 pip moves, resulting in poor R:R and 17% take-profit rate.


### Exploration Path 3: Plan Adherence Breakdown


**Context**: Rules vs Reality Dashboard shows 68% plan adherence overall, but 42% exit adherence (entry better than exit).


**Level 1**:
> **You**: "Why is my exit adherence so much lower than entry adherence?"
> **AI**: "Exit adherence drops when trades move into profit then pull back. Of 22 trades with exit adherence marked 'No,' 18 (82%) closed during pullbacks while still in profit. Pattern: You exit prematurely when price retraces, even if take profit wasn't hit and stop loss wasn't threatened."


**Level 2**:
> **You**: "How much pullback triggers premature exit?"
> **AI**: "Based on exit notes and P&L data, premature exits occur after 40-60% retracement of profit. Example: Trade reaches +30 pips, pulls back to +12 pips, you close (+12 pips exit, target was +50 pips). Average retracement before premature close: 52% of peak profit."


**Level 3**:
> **You**: "Do these premature exits occur more often at certain times of day?"
> **AI**: "Yes. Afternoon premature exits: 68% of total (15 out of 22). Morning premature exits: 32% (7 out of 22). You trade 60% morning / 40% afternoon (trade count), but premature exits are 68% afternoon. Afternoon timing amplifies premature exit behavior."


**Level 4**:
> **You**: "What emotions correlate with these afternoon premature exits?"
> **AI**: "Exit emotions on afternoon premature exits: 'Impatience' (11 times), 'Fear' (9 times), 'Relief' (8 times). Morning premature exits: 'Relief' (5 times), 'Satisfied' (3 times). Pattern: Afternoon premature exits are emotion-driven (impatience, fear). Morning premature exits are acceptance-driven (relief, satisfaction)."


**Level 5**:
> **You**: "If I had held these premature exits to stop or target, what would the average outcome be?"
> **AI**: "Cannot calculate precisely (don't have price data after your exit). However, of 22 premature exits, 18 were still in profit when closed. Average exit P&L: +$48. Your average planned take profit: +$150 (based on R:R ratio). Pattern: You're sacrificing ~$100 profit per premature exit by closing during retracements instead of holding to target or stop."


**Key Insight**: Premature exits occur after 50% profit retracement, mostly in afternoon, driven by impatience/fear, sacrificing ~$100/trade.


### Exploration Path 4: Multi-Dimensional Pattern


**Context**: AI Diagnostics mentions "Afternoon trades with low conviction show poor outcomes."


**Level 1**:
> **You**: "How much worse do afternoon low-conviction trades perform compared to morning high-conviction trades?"
> **AI**: "Morning trades with conviction 7-10: 68% win rate, +$128 avg P&L (22 trades). Afternoon trades with conviction 1-6: 28% win rate, -$74 avg P&L (18 trades). Gap: 40% win rate difference, $202 avg P&L difference. Pattern: Time + conviction combine to create strong performance variance."


**Level 2**:
> **You**: "Is it just time and conviction, or do emotions also play a role?"
> **AI**: "Emotions amplify the pattern. Afternoon + low conviction + FOMO/Impatience entry: 18% win rate (2 wins, 9 losses), -$136 avg P&L. Afternoon + low conviction + Calm/Confident entry: 44% win rate (4 wins, 5 losses), +$12 avg P&L. Pattern: Negative emotions worsen afternoon low-conviction outcomes significantly."


**Level 3**:
> **You**: "Do morning trades with FOMO emotion perform better than afternoon FOMO trades?"
> **AI**: "Yes. Morning FOMO: 40% win rate (4 wins, 6 losses), -$65 avg P&L. Afternoon FOMO: 20% win rate (2 wins, 8 losses), -$158 avg P&L. Pattern: FOMO underperforms in both sessions, but afternoon FOMO is significantly worse (-$93 difference)."


**Level 4**:
> **You**: "What percentage of my afternoon low-conviction FOMO trades also violated rules?"
> **AI**: "72% (8 out of 11). Most common violation: 'Max 3 trades per day' (6 violations). Pattern: Afternoon + low conviction + FOMO often represents trade #4 or #5, exceeding daily limits. These are late-session revenge or desperation trades."


**Level 5**:
> **You**: "Do any of these afternoon low-conviction FOMO trades occur on winning days, or only losing days?"
> **AI**: "90% occur on days already net-negative (10 out of 11). Only 1 afternoon FOMO trade occurred on a winning day. Pattern: Afternoon FOMO trades are almost always attempts to recover earlier losses. They rarely occur on profitable days."


**Key Insight**: Afternoon + low conviction + FOMO + after losses = cluster of high-risk revenge trades with 18% win rate.

## Mirror Principle in Deep Dive


AI Deep Dive Explorer adheres strictly to TradeMonkey's mirror philosophy: descriptive insight, no prescription.


### What Deep Dive Provides


**Correlations**:
> "FOMO trades have 22% win rate. Non-FOMO trades have 58% win rate."


**Conditional Analysis**:
> "Morning FOMO: 40% win rate. Afternoon FOMO: 20% win rate."


**Quantified Relationships**:
> "85% of conviction drops occur when drawdown exceeds 15 pips."


**Comparative Patterns**:
> "High-conviction trades ($128 avg P&L) outperform low-conviction trades (-$74 avg P&L) by $202 per trade."


**Temporal Patterns**:
> "Conviction drops occur 14 minutes after entry in afternoon trades, 38 minutes in morning trades."


### What Deep Dive Does NOT Provide


**Advice**:
❌ "You should stop trading FOMO setups."
✅ "FOMO trades have 22% win rate vs 58% for non-FOMO."


**Predictions**:
❌ "Your next afternoon trade will likely fail."
✅ "Afternoon trades historically show 28% win rate vs 68% for morning trades."


**Coaching**:
❌ "Take a break after losses to reset emotionally."
✅ "Trades entered after losses show 35% rule violation rate vs 8% on other days."


**Strategy Recommendations**:
❌ "Try scalping instead of swing trading."
✅ "Scalp-tagged trades: 55% win rate. Swing-tagged trades: 61% win rate."


**Emotional Management**:
❌ "Accept that pullbacks are normal and trust your stop loss."
✅ "82% of premature exits occur during pullbacks while still in profit."


### Reframing Coaching Questions


If you ask coaching questions, Deep Dive reframes to descriptive analysis:


**You**: "How do I stop revenge trading?"
**AI**: "I can show you when revenge-tagged trades occur, what conditions correlate with them, and how they perform. I cannot prescribe behavior changes. Would you like to explore patterns around revenge trades?"


**You**: "What should I do about my conviction drops?"
**AI**: "I can identify when conviction drops occur, what factors amplify them, and how they correlate with outcomes. Would you like to explore those patterns?"


**You**: "Is it bad to trade in the afternoon?"
**AI**: "Afternoon trades in your data show 42% win rate vs 68% morning win rate. Whether this matters depends on your goals and strategy, which I cannot evaluate. Would you like to explore what makes afternoon trades differ from morning trades?"


The mirror shows you the data. You decide what it means and what to do about it.


## Rate Limits and Session Boundaries


AI Deep Dive Explorer is rate-limited to manage costs and encourage focused exploration.


### Usage Limits


**Daily Limit**: 25 sessions per day per user


**Session Definition**: One complete exploration (up to 5 question-answer pairs)


**Reset Time**: Midnight UTC


**Shared Limits**: Deep Dive does NOT share its limit with other AI features. You have:
- 25 Deep Dive sessions per day (separate)
- 3 AI Diagnostics per day (separate)
- 5 Trade Thread Summaries per day (separate)
- 5 Reflection AI per day (separate)
- 20 Rules Coach requests per day (separate)


### Session Boundaries


**Session Start**: When you click "Start New Exploration" or ask your first question


**Session Active**: While you're asking follow-up questions (up to 5 total)


**Session End**: When you:
- Reach 5 questions (automatic end)
- Click "End Session" (manual end)
- Start a new exploration (previous session auto-ends)
- Close the browser (session abandoned)


**Abandoned Sessions**: If you ask 2 questions, then leave, that counts as 1 session (consumes 1 credit). You cannot resume abandoned sessions. Each new exploration starts fresh.


### Session Count vs Question Count


**Session-based limit**, not question-based:


- 1 session = 1-5 questions (consumes 1 credit regardless of question count)
- You can ask 1 question and end (1 credit used)
- You can ask 5 questions (1 credit used)
- Efficient use: Use all 5 levels before ending session


**Example**:
- Session 1: Ask 5 questions about conviction drops (1 credit)
- Session 2: Ask 3 questions about FOMO emotion (1 credit)
- Session 3: Ask 2 questions about time-based patterns (1 credit)
- Total credits used: 3 out of 25


### Cost Justification


Each session uses OpenAI API with estimated cost:


- Per session (5 questions): ~$0.10-0.25 (depending on data volume and question complexity)
- Daily cost for max usage (25 sessions): ~$2.50-6.25 per user


Rate limits ensure:
- Cost control for the platform
- Prevents compulsive checking (encourages focused weekly exploration)
- Ensures fair access in multi-user organizations


### When to Use Your Sessions


**Recommended usage pattern**:


**5-10 sessions per week**: Reserve for significant pattern investigation
- Use AI Diagnostics first to identify patterns (3 credits per week)
- Use 1-2 Deep Dive sessions per identified pattern (5-10 sessions per week)
- Save remaining sessions for ad-hoc exploration


**Not recommended**: Using all 25 sessions in one day
- Exploration fatigue (too much analysis at once)
- Diminishing returns (patterns don't change daily)
- Wastes credits (could spread over week for fresher data)


### What Happens When Limit Is Hit


If you've used all 25 sessions:


- **In-app message**: "You've reached your daily Deep Dive Explorer limit (25/25 used). Resets at midnight UTC (X hours)."
- **Button disabled**: "Start New Exploration" button grayed out
- **Alternative suggested**: "Use Time-Scoped Analytics and Execution Recap to review patterns manually until reset."


**You can still**:
- Read previous exploration transcripts (saved in your account)
- Use all other analytics (Psychology page, Rules vs Reality, Execution Recap)
- Use other AI features (Diagnostics, Thread Summary, Rules Coach have separate limits)


### Managing Your Session Credits


**Strategies to maximize value**:


1. **Use Diagnostics first**: Spend 1 Diagnostics credit to identify 5-10 patterns. Then spend 2-3 Deep Dive sessions exploring the most significant ones.


2. **Ask all 5 questions**: Don't end sessions after 2-3 questions. Use the full depth.


3. **Plan your questions**: Before starting a session, outline what you want to explore. Avoid aimless questioning.


4. **Focus on high-impact patterns**: Explore patterns with financial or psychological significance (large P&L impact, frequent occurrence, high emotional cost).


5. **Batch exploration sessions**: Reserve 1-2 hours weekly for deep exploration. Run 5-8 sessions back-to-back. Don't spread throughout the week (patterns change with new data).


6. **Save transcripts**: Copy-paste exploration transcripts to your notes. You can reference them without re-running sessions.


## Connection to Time-Scoped Analytics and Execution Recap


Deep Dive Explorer integrates with other TradeMonkey features to create a complete analysis workflow.


### Time-Scoped Analytics → Deep Dive


**Workflow**:
1. Open Psychology page
2. Apply time scope filter (Last 30 Days)
3. Notice pattern: "Win rate dropped from 58% (all-time) to 42% (last 30 days)"
4. Open Deep Dive Explorer
5. Ask: "Why has my win rate declined in the last 30 days?"
6. AI analyzes Last 30 Days data and compares to historical baseline
7. Continue drilling to identify causes (emotion shift? time-based change? rule violations?)


**Deep Dive respects time scope**: If you have Last 30 Days selected when you open Deep Dive, AI analyzes only that window. Toggle to All Time if you want broader analysis.


**Example Question for Time-Scoped Analysis**:
> "My Last 30 Days conviction average is 5.2 vs 6.8 all-time. What changed recently?"


AI will compare recent trades to historical trades and identify differences (emotion frequency, tag distribution, time-of-day shifts, etc.).


### Execution Recap → Deep Dive


**Workflow**:
1. Open Execution Recap
2. Filter to "Last 20 trades"
3. Notice visual pattern: 8 of last 10 afternoon trades have cluttered entry screenshots and low conviction
4. Open Deep Dive Explorer
5. Ask: "Why do my recent afternoon trades show lower conviction and worse setup quality?"
6. AI analyzes afternoon trades vs morning trades, recent vs historical
7. Continue drilling to identify contributing factors


**Recap provides visual context, Deep Dive provides quantitative analysis**:
- Recap shows you the before/after screenshots
- Deep Dive quantifies the pattern (conviction scores, win rates, emotion frequencies)


**Example Question from Recap Observation**:
> "I noticed 7 out of 10 recent losing trades were closed before stop loss. Why do I keep exiting prematurely?"


AI analyzes early-exit trades vs planned-exit trades to identify triggers (conviction drops, emotion patterns, time-based factors).


### Rules vs Reality → Deep Dive


**Workflow**:
1. Open Rules vs Reality Dashboard
2. Notice: "Max 3 trades per day" rule violated 8 times this month (8 violations out of 32 trading days = 25% violation rate)
3. Open Deep Dive Explorer
4. Ask: "When do I violate 'Max 3 trades per day' rule most often?"
5. AI identifies conditions (after losses? on certain days? in certain sessions?)
6. Continue drilling to explore amplifiers


**Deep Dive reveals rule violation triggers**:


**Example**:
> **You**: "When do I exceed max trades per day?"
> **AI**: "7 out of 8 violations occurred on days when your first trade was a loss. Days starting with wins: 2% violation rate. Days starting with losses: 35% violation rate. Pattern: Opening loss triggers overtrading."


### Psychology Page Metrics → Deep Dive


**Workflow**:
1. Open Psychology page
2. Notice: "FOMO emotion cost: -$2,800 this quarter"
3. Open Deep Dive Explorer
4. Ask: "What conditions lead to FOMO entries?"
5. AI identifies patterns (missed opportunities? after losses? specific setups?)
6. Continue drilling


**Deep Dive explains metrics from analytics dashboards**:


**Example**:
> **You**: "My conviction gap average is -3.8. What causes conviction to drop so much?"
> **AI**: "Conviction gaps > 3 points occur most often (68%) when trades go into 15+ pip drawdown before recovering or hitting stop. Smaller drawdowns correlate with smaller conviction gaps."


### Integrated Workflow Summary


**Complete Analysis Loop**:


1. **Broad Scan** (AI Diagnostics): Identify 5-10 significant patterns
2. **Visual Review** (Execution Recap): Observe patterns visually across multiple trades
3. **Quantify** (Time-Scoped Analytics): Measure pattern magnitude and time-based changes
4. **Drill Deep** (Deep Dive Explorer): Explore causality, conditions, amplifiers
5. **Validate** (Trade Recap / Threads): Review specific trades mentioned in exploration
6. **Enforce** (Rules vs Reality): Create rules to prevent negative patterns going forward


Deep Dive sits in the middle: after you've identified patterns, before you take action.

## Limitations and Notes


### Deep Dive Requires Sufficient Data


Exploration quality depends on data volume. Minimum requirements:


- **50+ trades**: Basic pattern detection
- **100+ trades**: Reliable multi-dimensional analysis
- **200+ trades**: Stable conditional comparisons (morning vs afternoon, emotion X vs Y)


With fewer than 50 trades, AI may respond:
> "Insufficient data for reliable analysis. You have 32 trades. For stable patterns, 50+ trades recommended. Would you like to proceed with limited data?"


### Deep Dive Analyzes Structured Data Only


AI cannot analyze:
- Free-text notes (unstructured, privacy risk)
- Chart screenshots (image processing not implemented)
- External factors not logged in TradeMonkey (market conditions, news events)


If your question references notes or screenshots:
> **You**: "In my notes, I mentioned being tired during afternoon trades. Does fatigue correlate with performance?"
> **AI**: "I cannot access your notes. However, I can analyze whether afternoon trades (when you mentioned fatigue) differ from morning trades in performance, conviction, or emotions. Would you like that analysis?"


### Correlation Is Not Causation


Deep Dive identifies correlations. You must interpret causality.


**Example**:
> **AI**: "Afternoon trades show 28% win rate vs 68% morning win rate."


**Possible causalities**:
- Afternoon timing causes worse performance (fatigue, impatience)
- Afternoon market conditions are different (lunch chop, session overlap)
- You trade different setups in afternoon (lower quality)
- Afternoon trades are emotionally driven (morning trades are planned)


AI cannot distinguish between these. You provide context.


### Small Sample Warnings


If a pattern has <5 instances, AI will note:
> "FOMO + afternoon + after losses: 3 trades, 0 wins. Note: Sample size too small for reliable conclusions. Pattern may be noise."


Do not over-interpret patterns with <5 instances.


### Session Transcripts Are Temporary


Exploration transcripts are saved for 30 days, then archived. If you want to keep insights long-term:
- Copy-paste transcript to your notes
- Screenshot key findings
- Export to external document


### Deep Dive Is Not Real-Time


Deep Dive analyzes closed trades only. Open trades are excluded. If you have 5 open trades and ask about recent performance, those 5 are not included in analysis.


### No Predictive Claims


Deep Dive describes past behavior. It does not predict future:


❌ "Your next afternoon trade will likely lose."
✅ "Afternoon trades historically have 28% win rate vs 68% morning win rate."


Past patterns may continue or change. Deep Dive shows tendencies, not certainties.


### Questions Must Be Data-Based


Deep Dive cannot answer hypothetical or opinion questions:


❌ "Should I switch from scalping to swing trading?"
❌ "What's the best time of day to trade?"
❌ "Is my strategy fundamentally flawed?"


These require judgment, not data analysis.


✅ "How do scalp-tagged trades perform vs swing-tagged trades?"
✅ "What time of day shows highest win rate in my data?"
✅ "What percentage of my trades follow my strategy rules?"


These are data-based and answerable.


### AI Limitations Apply


Language models (GPT-4o-mini) have known limitations:


- **Hallucination risk**: AI may occasionally misinterpret data. Cross-check findings against raw analytics.
- **Context window limits**: Very complex multi-dimensional questions may exceed AI's context window.
- **Ambiguity handling**: Vague questions get vague answers. Be specific.


If an answer seems incorrect, rephrase your question or verify against Psychology page / Rules vs Reality page.


### Exploration Is Not a Solution


Deep Dive reveals patterns and conditions. It does not fix them. After exploration, you must:


- Decide if the pattern matters (some correlations are acceptable)
- Determine what to change (rules, strategy, session timing, emotional management)
- Implement changes (adjust rules in Rules vs Reality, change trading schedule, etc.)
- Re-evaluate after 20-30 new trades (did changes improve outcomes?)


Deep Dive is a diagnostic tool, not a treatment.
