# Rules vs Reality Dashboard

## Purpose

The Rules vs Reality Dashboard is your long-term execution mirror for rule adherence. It shows how well you actually follow the trading rules you’ve set for yourself, over days, weeks, and months.

It does **not** judge whether your rules are good or bad, and it is not a performance leaderboard. It answers a simpler question:

> “Do I follow my rules? If not, when and in what context do I break them?”

## What This Feature Does

The dashboard aggregates rule checks across your trades and shows:

- **Global adherence** – Overall percentage of rule checks you passed across all trades.
- **Per-rule adherence** – Which rules you follow consistently and which you break most often.
- **Time patterns** – When violations happen (by day, week, or session such as morning vs afternoon).
- **Clusters and streaks** – Whether violations are isolated mistakes or appear in cascades (multiple rules broken in a short window).
- **Trend over time** – Whether your discipline is stable, improving, or eroding in recent trades vs your all-time baseline.
- **Context filters** – How adherence changes by tag, account, or time window (for example, challenge vs funded, scalps vs swings).

The dashboard reflects **adherence**, not **effectiveness**. You can have:

- High adherence + poor performance (rules might be misaligned)
- Low adherence + good performance (discipline problem)
- High adherence + good performance (rules are sound and followed)
- Low adherence + poor performance (rules are ignored and results suffer)

## How to Use It

1. **Make sure rules are defined**
   - Set up your trading rules (for example, max trades per day, time window, minimum R:R, no trading after X losses).
   - Scope rules where needed (by tag, account, or session).

2. **Open the dashboard after a meaningful sample**
   - Review after a block of trades (for example, weekly or monthly), not after every single trade.

3. **Scan your global adherence**
   - Look at the overall adherence percentage and the recent vs all-time comparison.
   - Note if recent adherence is stable, improving, or slipping.

4. **Identify weak rules in the table**
   - Sort by lowest adherence or highest violation count.
   - Click into a rule to see when and where it tends to be broken (time of day, tags, outcomes).

5. **Study the violation timeline**
   - Look for clusters: days or streaks where multiple rules were broken together.
   - Pay attention to periods that line up with losing streaks, emotional tags (for example, FOMO, revenge), or specific setups.

6. **Use filters for deeper context**
   - Narrow by:
     - Time window (Last 10 trades, Last 30 days, All Time)
     - Account (challenge vs funded, demo vs live)
     - Tags (for example, only scalps, only breakouts)
   - Compare all-time vs recent windows to see if discipline is drifting or recovering.

7. **Translate insights into action elsewhere**
   - Use what you see to refine rules (Rules Coach), adjust your trading schedule, or decide which contexts need more structure.
   - The dashboard shows the pattern; you decide what to change.

## Important Notes

- **Descriptive, not prescriptive**  
  The dashboard describes when rules were followed or broken and under what conditions. It does not tell you what you “should” do next.

- **Conditional rules only evaluate when applicable**  
  Some rules (for example, “No trading after 3 losses”) only evaluate when their condition is met. Their adherence is based on those limited situations, not all trades.

- **Incomplete data reduces evaluations**  
  Rules that depend on specific fields (for example, stop loss / take profit for R:R checks, tags for setup rules) are skipped if that data is missing. Skipped checks do not count as passes or violations.

- **Filters change what you see**  
  Time windows, account filters, and tag filters recalculate all adherence numbers for the current view. Always check which filters are active before interpreting trends.

- **Timezone matters for time-based rules**  
  Time-window rules use your configured timezone. If it’s wrong, time-based adherence may look off.

- **Edits and deletions recalculate adherence**  
  Editing trades or rules can change historical adherence. Deleting trades removes their violations and passes from the dashboard.
