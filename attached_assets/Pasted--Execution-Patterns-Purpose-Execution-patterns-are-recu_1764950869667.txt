# Execution Patterns

## Purpose

Execution patterns are recurring behaviors in your trading that show up across many trades, not just one. They connect your psychology, rule adherence, and outcomes to answer:

> “What do I tend to do over and over, in specific conditions, and what does it usually lead to?”

They do **not** tell you what to do next. They simply mirror what your data shows.

## What This Feature Does

Execution patterns combine multiple parts of your data:

- **Psychology** – emotions, conviction scores, plan adherence.
- **Compliance** – which rules you follow or break.
- **Outcomes** – win rate, P&L, risk-reward.
- **Timing** – time of day, session, day of week.
- **Context** – tags (setups, strategies, accounts, etc.).

From this, TradeMonkey surfaces **stable, recurring tendencies**, for example:

- “After an opening loss, you often exceed your daily trade limit.”
- “FOMO-tagged trades have much lower win rate than your baseline.”
- “Afternoon trades show lower conviction and lower adherence than morning trades.”

Patterns are **descriptive**, not rules. Rules are things you set (“Max 3 trades per day”). Patterns are things the system observes (“On days with a first-trade loss, you frequently trade more than 3 times”).

## Where You’ll See Execution Patterns

Execution patterns power several parts of the app:

- **AI Diagnostics**  
  Uses your data to highlight the most important patterns in a single report (for example, emotional cost, conviction decay, time-of-day effects).

- **AI Deep Dive Explorer**  
  Starts from a known pattern (“conviction drops during drawdowns”) and lets you ask follow-up questions to see when, where, and under what conditions it’s strongest.

- **Rules vs Reality Dashboard**  
  Shows rule-driven patterns (for example, which rules you break after a loss, or which sessions have more violations).

- **Time-Scoped Analytics**  
  Compares patterns across time windows (for example, “Last 30 days” vs “All time”) to show whether behaviors are improving, stable, or drifting.

- **Execution Recap**  
  Lets you visually confirm patterns across multiple trades (screenshots, emotions, conviction, exits).

You won’t always see a “Patterns” tab by name; instead, patterns appear as **clinical statements** embedded in these views.

## How to Use It

1. **Log complete data**
   - Record emotions, conviction, plan adherence, and tags along with each trade.
   - The more complete your data, the more reliable the patterns.

2. **Run your usual reviews**
   - Use Time-Scoped Analytics, Rules vs Reality, and AI Diagnostics for weekly or monthly reviews.
   - Let the system surface patterns instead of hunting manually.

3. **Read pattern statements carefully**
   - Focus on **what the pattern is**, **when it shows up**, and **how it differs from your baseline**.
   - Prioritize patterns with clear impact (large P&L differences, strong win-rate gaps, frequent rule violations).

4. **Drill deeper when needed**
   - Use AI Deep Dive Explorer when a pattern looks important (for example, FOMO, afternoon performance, post-loss behavior).
   - Ask follow-up questions like “When is this strongest?” or “What conditions usually surround this?”

5. **Decide what it means for you**
   - TradeMonkey reflects what happened; it does not tell you what to change.
   - Use patterns to inform adjustments to your rules, schedule, sizing, or strategies in other parts of the app.

## Example Pattern Statements

You might see statements like:

- “Trades entered after 2 PM show lower plan adherence and worse average P&L than morning trades.”
- “FOMO-tagged entries have significantly lower win rate and worse risk-reward than your overall average.”
- “On days where your first trade is a loss, your daily trade-count rule is broken far more often than on winning-start days.”
- “High-conviction entries correlate with better outcomes and higher adherence across setups.”

All of these are **mirrors**: they describe what your data is doing, without telling you what you should do next.

## Important Notes and Limits

- **Needs enough data**  
  Patterns only appear once there are enough trades and repeated situations. Very small samples may be hidden or clearly marked as “limited data.”

- **Data quality matters**  
  Missing emotions, conviction, or tags reduce what can be detected. Incomplete fields lead to weaker or fewer patterns.

- **Descriptive, not prescriptive**  
  Patterns say “what tends to happen,” not “what you must do.” Any changes you make are your own decisions.

- **Correlation ≠ causation**  
  If FOMO trades underperform, that’s a correlation. The system cannot know whether emotion itself, market conditions, or something else is driving the result.

- **Past ≠ guaranteed future**  
  Patterns are based on past trades. They show tendencies, not guarantees about upcoming trades.

## Support

If a pattern looks wrong or confusing, you can always cross-check it with your raw analytics. For help understanding what you’re seeing, contact **hello@trademonkey.app**.
