# Security

## Purpose of This Page

This page explains, at a high level, how TradeMonkey protects your data and where the security boundary ends.

It covers:

- How access to your data is controlled  
- How data is protected in transit and at rest  
- How multi-tenant isolation works  
- How AI features handle your data  
- What TradeMonkey is and is not responsible for  
- How to contact us about security questions

For all security-related questions or concerns, email **hello@trademonkey.app**.

## High-Level Security Approach

TradeMonkey uses a layered security model:

- **Authentication** – Users sign in with email and password, handled by Supabase Auth.  
- **Authorization** – Database Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data.  
- **Encryption** – All traffic uses HTTPS; the database is encrypted at rest by our infrastructure provider.  
- **Separation of Concerns** – Application data, authentication, billing, and AI processing each use specialized, hardened services (Supabase, Stripe, OpenAI).

TradeMonkey does not store plain text passwords or payment card numbers.

## Authentication and Access Control

- Sign-up and login are handled by **Supabase Auth**.  
- Passwords are **hashed** before storage and never stored in plain text.  
- Each request is tied to an authenticated user.  
- Access to data is enforced at the **database level** using Row-Level Security:
  - Each record is associated with an organization and/or user.
  - Queries automatically return only data that belongs to the authenticated user’s organization.
  - Users cannot see or modify other users’ data.

Sessions are managed with secure cookies and validated on each request.

## Data Protection (In Transit and At Rest)

- **In transit:**  
  - All traffic between your browser and TradeMonkey runs over **HTTPS (TLS)**.  
  - Session cookies are marked to be sent only over secure connections.

- **At rest:**  
  - Database and storage are encrypted at rest by Supabase and underlying cloud providers.  
  - Backups are also stored in encrypted form.

TradeMonkey does not run over plain HTTP.

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

TradeMonkey is multi-tenant: multiple users and organizations share the same underlying infrastructure.

Isolation is enforced by:

- An **organization identifier** attached to all relevant records (accounts, trades, rules, reflections, etc.).  
- Database-level **Row-Level Security (RLS)** policies that ensure:
  - A user can only read and write data for their own organization.
  - Cross-tenant access is blocked even if application code is incorrect.

This means one customer cannot see or modify another customer’s data.

## AI Features and Your Data

TradeMonkey uses OpenAI’s API to power certain features (for example AI Diagnostics, AI Deep Dive Explorer, Rules Coach, Reflection Analysis, and Trade Thread AI).

### What AI Typically Sees

For most AI features, TradeMonkey sends **aggregated statistics**, not raw trade-by-trade data or personal identifiers. Examples include:

- Counts of trades, win rates, average P&L  
- Aggregated breakdowns by emotion or rule outcome  
- Summary metrics needed to describe patterns

The AI uses these aggregates to produce **clinical, descriptive insights**. It does not receive:

- Your name, email, or login details  
- Broker account numbers or platform credentials

### Reflection Analysis (Special Case)

Reflection Analysis is the only feature where **your written text** may be sent to the AI:

- When you click a button such as “Analyze with AI,” the reflection text you wrote is sent to the model for analysis.
- This is **optional**. You can always keep writing reflections without AI analysis.

If you prefer not to send reflection text to AI, simply do not request AI analysis for those entries.

## What TradeMonkey Is Not Responsible For

TradeMonkey secures the application, database, and its own infrastructure. It does **not** control:

- **Broker platforms** (FTMO, prop firms, retail brokers, etc.)  
- **Trading platforms** (MT5, cTrader, TradingView, etc.)  
- **Your devices** (laptop, phone, tablet)  
- **Your network** (home Wi-Fi, office network, public Wi-Fi)

Your responsibilities include:

- Using a strong, unique password for TradeMonkey and your broker accounts  
- Keeping your devices and browser updated and free of malware  
- Protecting access to your devices (screen lock, logout on shared computers)  
- Avoiding untrusted networks or using a VPN when needed

TradeMonkey does not store broker logins or card numbers and cannot secure third-party platforms on your behalf.

## Contact and Security Questions

If you have a security question, concern, or believe you have found a potential issue:

- Email: **hello@trademonkey.app**  
- Subject: `Security question` or `Potential security issue`

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Any screenshots or logs that help explain the behavior (do not include passwords or full card numbers)

## Summary

- TradeMonkey uses **authentication, authorization, encryption, and RLS** to protect your data.  
- Only your organization can see your organization’s data.  
- AI features primarily use **aggregated, non-identifying** information; Reflection Analysis is optional and only sends the text you choose to analyze.  
- Core journaling and trading data remain under your control and are not exposed outside the platform except where you explicitly opt in.  
- Broker security, device security, and network security remain your responsibility.  
- For anything security-related, contact **hello@trademonkey.app**.
