Behavioral Recap
Purpose

Behavioral Recap is the behavior dashcam for a single trade.

It brings everything that occurred during that trade into one place — financial outcome, execution details, emotional state, rule checks, screenshots, and notes — so you can replay what actually happened after the fact, not what you remember later.

It does not coach, grade, or advise.
It records and presents the evidence.

What Behavioral Recap Shows

Behavioral Recap is organized to answer one question clearly:

What did I plan, what did I do, and what was the result?

Trade & Financial Record

Symbol, direction (buy/sell), account

Entry and exit prices, position size, duration

Planned vs actual stop loss and take profit

Final P&L (currency and percentage)

Planned R:R vs realized R outcome

This is the broker-reconciled outcome of the trade.

Psychology & Execution State

Entry and exit emotional state (you select from defined labels)

Entry and exit conviction scores (1–10)

Plan adherence at entry and exit (Followed / Partial / No)

Conviction gap showing whether confidence held, improved, or collapsed during the trade

This section captures how your internal state changed as the trade unfolded.

Rules vs Reality (Single-Trade View)

Which active rules were evaluated for this trade

Which rules passed, violated, or were skipped due to missing data

Clear visual indicators showing rule compliance at a glance

This answers:

Did this trade comply with the rules I said I follow?

Context: Screenshots, Tags, and Notes

Entry and exit chart screenshots (side-by-side when available)

Strategy, session, setup, and custom tags

Notes or reflections added at entry, mid-trade, exit, or post-trade

Optional AI summaries only when you choose to generate them

This provides visual and narrative context around the numbers and states.

The Trade Thread (Timeline View)

Each trade also has a Thread tab.

The Trade Thread is the event timeline for that trade:

Trade creation

Updates

Notes and reflections

Rule evaluations

Optional AI analysis events

Think of this as the raw footage, while the Behavioral Recap is the condensed replay.

How to Use Behavioral Recap
1. Open a trade

From the Behavioral Recap grid, Trades list, or analytics views, click a trade to open its recap.

2. Start with the outcome

Review the financial block first:

Entry vs exit

Planned vs actual risk

Final P&L and realized R

This anchors the review in what actually happened.

3. Compare plan vs execution

Planned SL/TP vs actual exit

Entry and exit plan adherence

Where execution drift occurred, if any

This surfaces behavioral gaps, not opinions.

4. Review emotional and conviction changes

Entry vs exit emotional state

Entry vs exit conviction

Conviction gap

This shows whether confidence stayed stable or degraded under pressure.

5. Check rule compliance

Scan which rules fired

Identify violations or skipped checks

Jump to Rules vs Reality for broader context if needed

6. Use context to interpret behavior

Compare screenshots to emotions and notes

Read reflections in sequence

Switch to the Trade Thread if you want the full timeline

How Behavioral Recap Fits Into the System

Behavioral Recap focuses on one trade at a time.

For broader views:

Trades / Analytics → cross-trade patterns

Psychology Tracking → emotion and conviction trends

Rules vs Reality → rule adherence over time

AI tools (optional) → summarized or deeper pattern exploration

Important Notes

Behavioral Recap is a behavior dashcam.
It documents what occurred; it does not tell you what to do next.
Once behavioral drift is visible, correction becomes possible.

The quality of insights depends on what you log.
More consistent emotions, conviction, notes, tags, and screenshots → clearer replays.

Behavioral Recap is post-trade only.
It does not provide real-time alerts or block trades.

Core tracking, rules, and analytics work with or without AI.
