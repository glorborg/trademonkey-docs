# Trade Recap


## What Trade Recap Is


Trade Recap is the comprehensive data summary view for a single trade. It displays all financial, psychological, and compliance data in one consolidated screen, designed for post-trade evaluation and review.


Trade Recap answers: "What are all the facts about this specific trade?"


It differs from related features:


- **Execution Recap**: Multi-trade visual feed for pattern scanning across trades
- **Threads**: Chronological timeline showing events as they unfolded during the trade
- **Trade Recap**: Static summary view showing all data fields and metrics in organized sections


Think of Trade Recap as the "trade report card"—not grading performance, but presenting all data points for your own evaluation.


## Data Displayed in Trade Recap


Trade Recap organizes data into sections:


### Financial Data Section


**Core Trade Details:**
- Symbol, side (buy/sell), account
- Entry price, exit price, position size
- Entry time, exit time, duration
- Stop loss (planned and actual if changed)
- Take profit (planned and actual if changed)
- P&L in currency and percentage


**Risk Metrics:**
- Risk amount (distance from entry to stop loss × position size)
- Reward amount (distance from entry to take profit × position size)
- R:R ratio (calculated at entry)
- Actual R outcome (P&L divided by risk amount)


Example:
> Entry: 1.0850, SL: 1.0830 (20 pips), TP: 1.0890 (40 pips)
> Position size: 1.0 lot, Risk: $200, Reward: $400, R:R: 2:1
> Exit: 1.0830 (stopped out), P&L: -$200, Actual R: -1R


### Psychology Data Section


**Entry Psychology:**
- Entry emotions (up to 3): Confident, Calm, Fear, FOMO, Revenge, Greed
- Entry conviction score (1-10)
- Entry plan adherence (Yes / Partial / No)
- Entry notes (free-text reasoning)


**Exit Psychology:**
- Exit emotions (up to 3): Relief, Regret, Pride, Frustration, Satisfied
- Exit conviction score (1-10)
- Exit plan adherence (Yes / Partial / No)
- Exit reason and notes


**Conviction Gap:**
- Calculated automatically: Exit Conviction - Entry Conviction
- Displayed with interpretation indicator (negative gap = discipline decay, positive gap = strengthened confidence, zero gap = consistent)


Example:
> Entry: Confident + Calm, conviction 8, adherence Yes
> Exit: Frustration + Regret, conviction 3, adherence No
> **Conviction Gap: -5** (Discipline decay detected)


### Visual Context Section


**Screenshots:**
- Entry chart screenshot (with timestamp)
- Exit chart screenshot (with timestamp)
- Additional mid-trade screenshots if logged


**Screenshot Comparison:**
If both entry and exit screenshots exist, Trade Recap displays them side-by-side for quick visual comparison. This allows you to validate:


- Did the setup quality at entry support your entry conviction score?
- Did the exit conditions justify your exit decision?
- Was the exit at your planned level (stop/target) or emotional (mid-trade)?


### Rules vs Reality Section


**Rule Evaluation Summary:**
- Total rules evaluated
- Rules passed
- Rules violated
- Rules skipped (missing data)


**Violation Details:**
For each violated rule:
- Rule name (e.g., "Max 3 trades per day")
- Violation reason (e.g., "Trade #4 exceeds limit of 3")
- Violation timestamp (when it was detected)
- Severity (warning or violation)


**Adherence Indicators:**
- Visual indicators (pass/fail/skip) for each rule
- Link to Rules vs Reality Dashboard for full context


Example:
> **Rules Evaluated: 5**
> - ✅ Allowed time window (8:00-12:00 EST) - Pass
> - ✅ Min R:R ratio (2:1) - Pass
> - ❌ Max 3 trades per day - **Violation** (Trade #4)
> - ⚠️ No trading after 3 losses - Skipped (no prior losses today)
> - ✅ Allowed instruments (EURUSD) - Pass


### Tags and Classification


**Trade Tags:**
- Setup tags (e.g., breakout, pullback, reversal)
- Session tags (e.g., london-session, new-york-open)
- Strategy tags (e.g., scalp, swing)
- Custom tags


Tags serve two purposes in Trade Recap:


1. **Filtering and searching**: Find similar trades by tag
2. **Rule context**: Shows which tag-scoped rules were evaluated


### Reflections and Notes


**Notes:**
- Entry notes (logged at entry)
- Mid-trade notes (if any were added during execution)
- Exit notes (logged at exit)


**Post-Trade Reflections:**
- All reflections attached to this trade (can be multiple)
- Reflection timestamps (immediate, end-of-session, weekly review)
- AI-generated reflection summaries if available


Reflections in Trade Recap are displayed collapsed by default but expandable for review.

## Role in Post-Trade Evaluation


Trade Recap is designed for structured post-trade review. It presents data in a way that supports systematic evaluation across multiple dimensions.


### Plan Adherence Review


Trade Recap consolidates plan-related data:


**Entry Plan:**
- Did you enter at your planned price? (Compare planned entry vs actual entry)
- Did you set SL and TP as planned? (Compare planned risk vs actual risk)
- Did you follow entry rules? (Entry plan adherence flag)
- Did you enter with conviction? (Entry conviction score)


**Exit Plan:**
- Did you exit at your planned level? (Check if exit price = SL or TP)
- Did you follow exit rules? (Exit plan adherence flag)
- Did you exit with conviction? (Exit conviction score)


**Plan Variance Detection:**
If entry or exit plan adherence is marked "No" or "Partial," Trade Recap highlights this with visual indicators. You can quickly see:


- Where the plan broke down (entry or exit)
- What the variance was (notes explain the deviation)
- Whether the variance was profitable or costly


Example:
> **Entry Plan Adherence: Yes** (All criteria met, R:R 2:1, within time window)
> **Exit Plan Adherence: No** (Planned exit: Stop loss at 1.0820, Actual exit: 1.0830 panic close)
> **Variance Cost: $0** (Stopped out anyway, but closed 10 pips early)


### Emotional State Review


Trade Recap shows your emotional state at critical decision points:


**Entry Emotions:**
Did your entry emotions align with setup quality?


- High conviction + Confident/Calm emotions → Likely a solid setup
- Low conviction + Fear/FOMO emotions → Likely a weak or impulsive setup


**Exit Emotions:**
Did your exit emotions indicate disciplined execution or emotional override?


- Exit at planned level + Satisfied/Pride emotions → Disciplined exit
- Exit before planned level + Regret/Frustration emotions → Emotional exit


**Emotional Consistency:**
Trade Recap shows whether emotions remained stable or shifted:


- Confident → Satisfied = Emotional alignment (good sign)
- Confident → Regret = Emotional reversal (discipline breakdown or outcome disappointment)


### SL/TP Variance Analysis


Trade Recap calculates variance between planned and actual SL/TP:


**Stop Loss Variance:**
- Planned SL: 1.0830
- Actual exit: 1.0835
- Variance: +5 pips (closed before stop was hit)


**Take Profit Variance:**
- Planned TP: 1.0890
- Actual exit: 1.0875
- Variance: -15 pips (closed before target was hit)


**Variance Interpretation:**
- Positive SL variance (closed before stop) → Panic exit or breakeven close
- Negative TP variance (closed before target) → Impatience or fear of reversal
- Zero variance (exit = SL or TP) → Plan-compliant execution


Trade Recap does not judge variance. It only shows the gap between plan and execution.


### Conviction Change Analysis


Conviction gap is displayed prominently:


```
Entry Conviction: 8
Exit Conviction: 3
Gap: -5
```


**Gap Categories:**
- **-5 or worse**: Severe discipline decay (conviction collapsed)
- **-3 to -4**: Moderate discipline decay (confidence weakened significantly)
- **-1 to -2**: Minor discipline decay (slight confidence loss, normal)
- **0**: Consistent conviction (stable throughout trade)
- **+1 to +3**: Strengthened confidence (rare, usually positive sign)


Trade Recap displays gap category visually (color-coded or labeled) to make patterns obvious during review.


### Rule Compliance Summary


Rules vs Reality section in Trade Recap shows:


- Which rules were checked (all active rules that apply to this trade)
- Which rules passed (you followed these rules)
- Which rules violated (you broke these rules)
- Which rules skipped (insufficient data to evaluate)


This allows you to quickly assess:


- Was this trade rule-compliant overall?
- If violations occurred, which rules were broken?
- Were violations due to missing data or actual rule-breaking?


Example:
> **Overall Compliance: 80%** (4 passed, 1 violated, 0 skipped, 0 errors)
> Violated: "Max 3 trades per day" (This was trade #4)

## How Trade Recap Integrates With Other Features


Trade Recap is a hub that connects to multiple TradeMonkey features:


### Integration with Rules vs Reality


**Rules Display:**
Trade Recap shows all rule evaluations for this trade. Clicking on a rule violation opens the Rules vs Reality Dashboard filtered to that specific rule, showing:


- All trades that violated this rule
- Adherence percentage for this rule
- Patterns around when this rule is broken


**Rules Coach Link:**
If you want to understand why a rule was violated, Trade Recap provides a "Ask Rules Coach" button. This opens the Rules Helper AI with context pre-loaded:


> "Explain why my 'Max 3 trades per day' rule was violated on this trade. What led to trade #4?"


### Integration with Psychology Tracking


**Psychology Data Display:**
All psychology data (emotions, conviction, adherence) is shown in Trade Recap. Clicking on emotion tags or conviction scores opens the Psychology Tracking page filtered to:


- All trades with the same entry emotion
- All trades with similar conviction scores
- All trades with the same adherence status


This allows you to compare: "How do all my FOMO trades perform?"


### Integration with Threads


**View Full Thread:**
Trade Recap includes a "View Thread" button that opens the chronological timeline for this trade. This shows:


- How events unfolded in sequence
- Mid-trade notes and thoughts
- When conviction shifted
- When rule violations occurred


Use Trade Recap to review the data. Use Threads to understand the story.


### Integration with Execution Recap


**Find Similar Trades:**
Trade Recap includes filters that link to Execution Recap:


- "View all trades with entry emotion: FOMO"
- "View all trades with conviction gap < -4"
- "View all trades on this account"
- "View all trades with this symbol"


This allows you to move from single-trade analysis (Trade Recap) to pattern detection (Execution Recap).


### Integration with AI Features


**AI Thread Summary:**
If you generated an AI Thread Summary for this trade (5/day limit), it appears in the reflections section of Trade Recap. The AI summary highlights:


- Key patterns detected (conviction gaps, emotional shifts, rule violations)
- Behavioral signals (discipline decay, impulsive entry, panic exit)
- Context-specific insights (how this trade compares to your typical behavior)


**Deep Dive Explorer:**
Trade Recap includes a "Explore in AI Deep Dive" button. Clicking it opens AI Deep Dive Explorer with this trade pre-loaded as context. You can ask:


- "Why did my conviction drop so much on this trade?"
- "Was this exit emotion typical for me, or unusual?"
- "Do all my trades on this symbol show similar patterns?"


### Integration with Screenshots


**Screenshot Display:**
Entry and exit screenshots are displayed side-by-side in Trade Recap. Clicking a screenshot opens full-screen lightbox for detailed review.


**Screenshot Context:**
Trade Recap overlays key data on screenshots:


- Entry screenshot: Entry price, SL, TP, entry time, entry conviction
- Exit screenshot: Exit price, exit time, exit conviction, P&L


This visual context validates whether your emotions and conviction matched observable setup quality.

## Trade Recap in Daily and Weekly Review Workflows


Trade Recap is designed for structured review sessions. Here are common workflows:


### End-of-Day Review (5-10 Minutes)


**Goal**: Quickly review today's trades for immediate patterns and lessons.


**Workflow:**
1. Open Trade Recap for each trade taken today (typically 1-5 trades)
2. For each trade, check:
   - Plan adherence (entry and exit): Did you follow your plan?
   - Rule compliance: Did you break any rules?
   - Conviction consistency: Did conviction stay stable or collapse?
   - Emotional state: What emotions appeared, and do they match setup quality?
3. Note any immediate patterns:
   - "All 3 afternoon trades had lower conviction than morning trades"
   - "I violated 'Max 3 trades per day' rule on last trade"
   - "Exit emotions on losing trades: all Frustration or Regret"
4. Add brief end-of-day reflections to significant trades (biggest win, biggest loss, most emotional)
5. Close without deep analysis (save deep analysis for weekly review)


**What to look for:**
- Discipline breakdowns (plan adherence marked "No")
- Rule violations (especially repeated violations)
- Emotional inconsistency (confident entry, regretful exit)
- Conviction gaps > 3 (discipline decay)


### End-of-Week Review (30-60 Minutes)


**Goal**: Identify patterns across the week and adjust rules or behavior.


**Workflow:**
1. Open Trade Recap for all significant trades from the week:
   - Biggest winners and losers (by P&L)
   - Trades with rule violations
   - Trades with conviction gap > 4
   - Trades with emotional exit emotions (Regret, Frustration)
2. For each trade, review:
   - What was the plan? (Entry notes, planned SL/TP, entry conviction)
   - What actually happened? (Exit notes, actual exit, exit conviction)
   - Where did discipline break? (Adherence flags, conviction gap, emotional shift)
   - What rules were violated? (Rules vs Reality section)
3. Look for repeating patterns across multiple Trade Recaps:
   - "4 out of 5 losing trades had conviction gap > 4"
   - "All FOMO-tagged trades were rule violations (exceeded max daily trades)"
   - "3 out of 4 afternoon trades closed before stop or target was hit"
4. Add weekly review reflections to trades:
   - "Part of a larger pattern: I panic exit on minor pullbacks"
   - "This was typical of my Friday trading: lower conviction, more impulsive"
5. Use insights to update rules:
   - If "Max 3 trades per day" was violated 3 times this week, either enforce it better or adjust it to "Max 5 trades per day"
   - If afternoon trades consistently underperform, create "No trading after 2 PM" rule
6. Generate AI Thread Summaries for 2-3 most significant trades (5/day limit) to get deeper insights


**What to look for:**
- Repeated rule violations (same rule broken multiple times)
- Emotional patterns (same emotions correlate with poor outcomes)
- Session-based deterioration (morning vs afternoon performance)
- Conviction decay trends (does conviction always collapse in certain conditions?)


### Monthly Review (1-2 Hours)


**Goal**: Assess long-term behavioral trends and strategy effectiveness.


**Workflow:**
1. Use Execution Recap to filter and scan 50-100 trades from the month
2. Identify 10-15 trades worth deep review (outliers, violations, emotional trades)
3. Open Trade Recap for each selected trade and review systematically
4. Look for month-long patterns:
   - Did conviction gap worsen over time? (Week 1 vs Week 4)
   - Did rule violations increase? (First half vs second half of month)
   - Did emotional tags shift? (More FOMO or Revenge trades as month progressed?)
5. Compare Trade Recap data to Time-Scoped Analytics and Psychology Tracking pages to validate patterns
6. Adjust rules, session schedules, or account limits based on findings


**What to look for:**
- Behavioral decay over time (discipline starts strong, deteriorates)
- Strategy performance variance (which setups/tags/times work best)
- Account-specific patterns (do challenge accounts show different psychology than funded?)


### Pre-Session Review (Optional)


**Goal**: Review yesterday's last trade or most recent emotional trade before starting new session.


**Workflow:**
1. Open Trade Recap for most recent trade (or most recent losing trade)
2. Quickly check:
   - What emotion did I exit with? (Frustration? Regret?)
   - Did I violate any rules?
   - Did conviction collapse?
3. Use this as context for today's session:
   - If yesterday ended with revenge trade, be extra cautious about first trade today
   - If yesterday ended with discipline violation, review rules before trading


**What to look for:**
- Emotional carryover (frustration from yesterday may affect today's first trade)
- Rule violations (reminder of what not to do today)

## Clinical Interpretation (Mirror, Not Advice)


Trade Recap presents data without judgment or prescription. It shows what happened, not what you should do.


### What Trade Recap Shows (Descriptive)


**Plan Variance:**
> "Entry plan adherence: Yes. Exit plan adherence: No. Planned exit: Stop loss at 1.0820. Actual exit: 1.0835 (15 pips before stop)."


This is factual. It does not say "You should have let the stop protect you" or "You panicked." It shows the gap between plan and execution.


**Conviction Gap:**
> "Entry conviction: 8. Exit conviction: 3. Gap: -5 (Severe discipline decay detected)."


This is observational. It does not say "You need to work on mental resilience" or "You should trust your setups." It shows conviction collapsed.


**Emotional Data:**
> "Entry emotions: Confident, Calm. Exit emotions: Frustration, Regret."


This is a record. It does not say "Regret is bad" or "You should feel satisfied instead." It shows emotional shift occurred.


**Rule Violations:**
> "Max 3 trades per day: Violated (Trade #4). You have violated this rule 3 times this week."


This is compliance tracking. It does not say "You lack discipline" or "You should reduce max trades to 2." It shows you broke your own rule repeatedly.


### What Trade Recap Does NOT Do (Prescriptive)


Trade Recap never says:


- "You should have held until your stop loss was hit"
- "Stop trading with FOMO emotion"
- "You need to increase your conviction before entering"
- "This was a bad trade" or "This was a good trade"
- "You're overtrading" or "You're undertrading"


It only mirrors the data. You interpret and decide what to do with it.


### Why This Matters


TradeMonkey is not a coach or therapist. It does not know:


- Whether your plan was good (maybe your planned stop was too tight)
- Whether your emotional exit was wrong (maybe price was rejecting and your intuition saved you)
- Whether your rule violation was justified (maybe market conditions changed and breaking the rule made sense)


Only you have the full context. Trade Recap gives you the data. You apply the context and decide:


- Was this acceptable or unacceptable?
- Should I adjust my plan, my rules, or my execution?
- Is this a pattern that matters or a one-off anomaly?


### Interpretation Examples


**Pattern 1: Conviction Collapse on Minor Pullbacks**
Trade Recap shows:
> Trade A: Entry conviction 8, exit conviction 3, closed 10 pips before stop
> Trade B: Entry conviction 9, exit conviction 4, closed 8 pips before stop
> Trade C: Entry conviction 7, exit conviction 3, closed 12 pips before stop


**What the mirror shows:**
You consistently close trades early when conviction collapses. Exit screenshots show minor pullbacks, not stop-outs.


**What the mirror does NOT say:**
"Stop panic selling" or "Trust your setups." It only shows the pattern.


**Your decision:**
Maybe you need tighter stops (so your planned exit matches your emotional tolerance). Maybe you need to avoid trades where conviction isn't 9+. Maybe you need a rule: "No closing trades unless stop or target is hit." Trade Recap doesn't decide for you.


**Pattern 2: High Conviction, Low Adherence**
Trade Recap shows:
> Entry conviction: 9, Entry plan adherence: No, Entry notes: "Perfect setup but entered 5 pips early, didn't wait for confirmation"


**What the mirror shows:**
You had high confidence in the setup but didn't follow your entry criteria.


**What the mirror does NOT say:**
"You should wait for confirmation" or "Your impatience is costing you." It only shows the gap.


**Your decision:**
Maybe your entry criteria are too strict (perfect setups are rare, so you jump early). Maybe you need a rule: "No entry unless all criteria met." Maybe high conviction justifies bending rules occasionally. Trade Recap doesn't decide for you.


## Limitations and Notes


### Trade Recap Requires Complete Data
If you skip emotions, conviction, notes, or screenshots, Trade Recap becomes a sparse financial record. The more complete your data, the more useful Trade Recap becomes for evaluation.


### Trade Recap Is Not Real-Time
Trade Recap is designed for post-trade review. It does not provide real-time alerts or prevent bad decisions. It shows you what happened after the fact.


### Trade Recap Does Not Aggregate
Trade Recap focuses on one trade at a time. For cross-trade patterns, use:


- Execution Recap (visual pattern scanning)
- Psychology Tracking (emotion-based analytics)
- Time-Scoped Analytics (time-based trends)
- AI Deep Dive Explorer (pattern exploration)


### Multiple Views Serve Different Purposes
TradeMonkey provides multiple ways to view trade data:


- **Trade Recap**: Single-trade data summary (all fields in sections)
- **Threads**: Single-trade chronological timeline (events as they unfolded)
- **Execution Recap**: Multi-trade visual feed (pattern detection)


You need all three:


- Trade Recap for systematic evaluation
- Threads for narrative understanding
- Execution Recap for pattern scanning


### Trade Recap Interpretation Depends on Context
Trade Recap shows variance and gaps, but not whether they matter:


- Conviction gap of -5 might be acceptable if you still exited at your planned stop
- Plan adherence "No" might be justified if market conditions changed
- Rule violation might be necessary if the rule is too strict


Only you know whether a gap is a problem or not. Trade Recap surfaces the gap. You decide its significance.


### Review Frequency Varies
Some traders review every trade immediately. Some review only at end of day. Some review only significant trades (big wins, big losses, emotional trades). All approaches are valid.


More frequent review produces more awareness but adds friction. Less frequent review reduces friction but may miss patterns. Find your balance.


### Trade Recap Is Backward-Looking
Trade Recap analyzes completed trades. It does not predict future performance or prevent mistakes. It helps you learn from what already happened, not prevent what might happen.


For forward-looking accountability, use Rules vs Reality (creates rules for future trades) and pre-session reviews (remind yourself of recent patterns before trading).
