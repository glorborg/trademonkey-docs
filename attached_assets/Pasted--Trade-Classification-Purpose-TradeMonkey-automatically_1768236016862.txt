# Trade Classification

## Purpose
TradeMonkey automatically classifies your trades so it knows which rules to apply, which patterns to analyze, and how to group behavior accurately.

You never need to define a tagging system or maintain a taxonomy.

## How Classification Works
After each trade, TradeMonkey analyzes:
* market context
* execution behavior
* trade duration
* psychology data
* similarity to prior trades

From this, it assigns each trade to a behavioral classification (e.g., momentum scalp, range trade, late entry).

These classifications are used internally by:
* Rules vs Reality
* Execution Recaps
* Pattern analysis
* AI diagnostics

## Your Role (Minimal by Design)
**You are not responsible for:**
* creating labels
* deciding tag names
* managing consistency
* configuring rule scopes

**Your only role is to:**
* confirm when a classification is correct
* correct it when it's wrong

This keeps your focus on trading decisions, not system setup.

## When You'll Be Asked to Intervene
TradeMonkey will only ask for input when:
* a trade doesn't clearly fit existing patterns
* two similar trades behave differently
* rule evaluation requires clarification

You'll see prompts like:
> "Does this trade belong with these similar ones?"

These corrections help the system learn and improve automatically.

## System Context vs Behavior
**Some classifications are derived automatically** and never require confirmation, such as:
* trading session
* direction (long/short)
* duration bucket
* instrument family

**Others relate to behavior and intent,** which only you can validate.

## Why This Matters
Accurate classification allows TradeMonkey to:
* apply the right rules to the right trades
* detect behavioral drift earlier
* avoid false violations
* surface patterns you would otherwise miss

This happens without requiring upfront configuration.

## Key Principle
If you ever feel like you're "setting up a tagging system," something has gone wrong.

**TradeMonkey is designed to adapt to how you trade, not the other way around.**
