# Trade Recap

## Purpose

Trade Recap is the single-page summary for a specific trade. It brings together financials, psychology, rules, screenshots, and notes so you can review what actually happened after the trade is closed.

## What Trade Recap Shows

### Financial and Risk Data
- Symbol, side (buy/sell), account
- Entry and exit price, position size, duration
- Planned and actual stop loss / take profit
- P&L in currency and percentage
- Risk and reward amounts, initial R:R, and actual R outcome

### Psychology and Conviction
- Entry and exit emotions (you select from common options like Confident, Fear, FOMO, Regret, etc.)
- Entry and exit conviction scores
- Entry and exit plan adherence (Yes / Partial / No)
- Conviction gap (exit conviction minus entry conviction) to show whether your confidence held, improved, or collapsed

### Rules vs Reality
- Which of your active rules were checked for this trade
- Which rules passed, violated, or were skipped due to missing data
- Simple visual indicators so you can see at a glance if this trade was rule-compliant

### Screenshots, Tags, and Notes
- Entry and exit chart screenshots, shown side-by-side when available
- Setup, session, strategy, and custom tags
- Entry, mid-trade, exit notes and any post-trade reflections
- Optional AI-generated summaries (when you choose to use AI features)

## How to Use Trade Recap

1. **Open a trade**  
   From your trade list or Execution Recap, open a single trade to view its Trade Recap.

2. **Start with the financial block**  
   Confirm basic details (symbol, size, entry/exit prices, SL/TP, P&L, R:R). Check whether the actual outcome matched the original risk and reward you planned.

3. **Review plan vs execution**  
   - Compare planned SL/TP with where you actually exited.  
   - Look at entry and exit plan adherence to see where you followed or broke your plan.

4. **Check emotions and conviction**  
   - Review entry and exit emotions and conviction scores.  
   - Look at the conviction gap to see whether your confidence stayed stable or dropped as the trade unfolded.

5. **Scan rule compliance**  
   - See which rules fired for this trade and whether each one passed or was violated.  
   - Use the link from a specific rule to jump into the Rules vs Reality view for more context if needed.

6. **Use screenshots and notes for context**  
   - Compare entry and exit screenshots to see if the chart context matches how you felt and what you wrote.  
   - Expand reflections if you added them during or after the trade.

7. **Jump into other views when needed**  
   - **Threads:** to see the full timeline of events and notes for this trade.  
   - **Execution Recap:** to find similar trades and patterns.  
   - **Psychology Tracking:** to compare this trade’s emotions/conviction to others.  
   - **AI tools (optional):** to generate summaries or deeper pattern analysis when you want AI assistance.

## Suggested Review Routines

- **End of day:**  
  Quickly walk through Trade Recap for each trade you took, focusing on plan adherence, rule violations, conviction gaps, and emotional shifts.

- **End of week:**  
  Pick the most important trades (biggest wins/losses, emotional trades, rule violations) and review their Trade Recaps to spot repeated patterns.

- **Monthly:**  
  Use Execution Recap or analytics to find outlier or representative trades, then open their Trade Recaps to confirm long-term behavioral and rule-based patterns.

- **Pre-session (optional):**  
  Before you start trading, review the last trade or last emotional trade’s Trade Recap to remind yourself what you want to avoid repeating.

## Important Notes

- Trade Recap is a read-only mirror of your data. It shows what happened; it does not tell you what you should do.
- The more consistently you log emotions, conviction, notes, tags, and screenshots, the more useful Trade Recap becomes.
- Trade Recap is for post-trade review. It does not provide real-time alerts or block trades.
- Trade Recap focuses on one trade at a time. For cross-trade patterns, use Execution Recap, Psychology Tracking, analytics pages, or AI Deep Dive.
- Core journaling, rules, and analytics work even if you choose not to use AI features.
