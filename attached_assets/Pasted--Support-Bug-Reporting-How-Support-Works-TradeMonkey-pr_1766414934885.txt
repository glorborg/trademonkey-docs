# Support & Bug Reporting

## How Support Works

TradeMonkey provides live, in-app support during active trading hours, when issues are most likely to surface.

Live support is available:

During the London session

During and up to the end of the New York session

These windows are intentional — they align with when users are actively trading, reviewing trades, importing data, or reconciling sessions.

Support is accessed inside the app via the support modal.

## What Happens Outside Live Support Hours?

If you submit a support request after the New York session has ended, your ticket is not ignored or delayed indefinitely.

Instead:

Your message is queued

It is reviewed and responded to during the next live London session

This ensures:

Responses are thoughtful, accurate, and context-aware

Issues are handled when the team is actively available

You receive answers from people who understand the platform deeply

TradeMonkey does not provide 24/7 reactive support, but it does provide consistent, predictable, human support.

## What Support Is Best Used For

Use in-app support when you need help with:

Understanding something you’re seeing in your data

Trade imports or reconciliation questions

Rules behaving differently than expected

Clarifying how a feature is intended to work

Confirming whether something is a bug or expected behavior

If something “feels off,” support is the right place to sanity-check it.

## Reporting Bugs

### What Counts as a Bug

A bug is when the platform behaves contrary to its documented behavior, for example:

Trades fail to import when the CSV is correctly formatted

Data disappears or changes unexpectedly

Rules evaluate incorrectly despite required data being present

UI elements fail to load or respond

Errors appear that prevent normal use

Unexpected patterns or poor performance are not automatically bugs — often they are signals of missing data or incomplete reconciliation.

If you’re unsure, submit the issue anyway. Support will help determine what’s happening.

### How to Report a Bug (Best Practices)

To help us resolve issues quickly, include:

What you expected to happen

What actually happened

The account and date range involved

Screenshots or screen recordings if helpful  
(Do not include passwords or sensitive credentials)

Clear context reduces back-and-forth and speeds resolution.

### What Happens After You Submit a Bug

Bugs are reviewed during live support hours

Confirmed issues are logged and prioritized

You’ll be updated if further clarification is needed

TradeMonkey favors fixing root causes, not quick patches that introduce new ambiguity.

## A Note on Signals vs Bugs

Because TradeMonkey is a behavior dashcam, it often reveals things users haven’t seen before.

Noticing:

Skipped rules

Missing emotions

Conviction gaps

Data gaps after imports

Is usually a signal, not a failure.

Support helps you distinguish between:

“The system isn’t working”

“The system is showing me something new”

Both matter — only one is a bug.

## Summary

Support is provided inside the app

Live support runs during London and end of New York sessions

Tickets submitted later are answered during the next London session

Bugs and questions are handled through the same support flow

Clear context leads to faster, better answers
