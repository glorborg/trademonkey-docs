# Calendar & News Events

## Purpose

Calendar & News Events is not a generic economic calendar. It is an execution context guardrail designed to protect discipline during scheduled volatility — especially for challenge traders and rule-based workflows.

Its core job is to answer:  
"Are you trading during scheduled uncertainty you said you'd avoid?"

It does this by:  
Highlighting high-impact scheduled events (CPI, NFP, FOMC, rate decisions, etc.)  
Defining volatility windows before/after those events  
Enforcing news-based rules via the Rules vs Reality engine  
Creating predictable avoidance zones around high-risk periods

This is a protective layer, not a strategy or prediction tool.

## What This Feature Is NOT

To avoid confusion with full economic calendars (ForexFactory, MyFxBook, broker calendars):  
It is NOT:
- A full economic calendar with every low/medium/high event
- A forecasting tool (no forecasts, actuals, or "beats/misses" logic)
- A signal generator or trade idea source
- A sentiment/positioning dashboard
- A real-time, intraday news feed

It IS:
- A curated list of high-impact events only
- Integrated tightly with Rules vs Reality for:
  time-based restrictions  
  violation detection  
  post-trade review

## What the Calendar Surfaces

The Calendar & News Events feature provides five execution-relevant elements.

### 1. High-Impact Events

Curated macro events that commonly cause large moves and execution risk:  
Monetary policy: FOMC, ECB/BOE/BOJ/RBA/SNB rate decisions, statements, minutes  
Employment: NFP, US unemployment rate, major employment releases  
Inflation: CPI, PPI, key CPI prints for majors (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)  
Growth / Activity: Major GDP releases, key retail sales, select high-impact prints  
No forecasts, actual values, or previous values are stored.

### 2. Volatility Windows

Every high-impact event defines a volatility window around its scheduled time:  
Pre-event window: X minutes before event (e.g. 15 / 30 / 60)  
Post-event window: Y minutes after event (e.g. 15 / 30 / 60)  
These windows are what your rules reference and what the Rules vs Reality engine uses for violation checks.

### 3. Restricted News Zones (Rule-Based)

News rules turn volatility windows into restricted zones where trading is not allowed (according to your own rules).  
Typical behaviors:  
"No trading ±30 minutes around high-impact USD events"  
"No trades if high-impact news is within 15 minutes ahead"  
"No trading pairs whose currencies have high-impact news within ±30 minutes"  
When a trade's timestamp falls inside one of these restricted zones, Rules vs Reality flags a news violation.

### 4. Session Context

Calendar data is layered on top of your session structure (Asian / London / New York):  
Shows which sessions contain high-impact events  
Helps reconcile session rules with news rules  
Makes it obvious when your "normal trading hours" are mostly blocked by news

### 5. Visual Cueing of High-Risk Periods

In calendar or timeline views, the feature visually marks elevated-risk windows:  
Red/blocked bands around news times  
Event markers at release timestamps  
Shaded ranges during pre/post volatility windows

## How to Use It

### 1. Pre-Session: Scan the Day

Before trading:  
Open calendar view or widget.  
Look at today's high-impact events and their windows.  
Mark restricted zones based on your rules (e.g. ±30 minutes).  
Decide whether to trade at all today and which hours are realistically "clean."

### 2. During Session: Guardrails Against Impulses

When a setup appears:  
Check time vs upcoming/ongoing events.  
Compare with your news rules (e.g. "no trades within 30 minutes of news").  
If inside a restricted window, you know this is a rule break, not just "a bit risky."

### 3. Post-Session: Review Trades Near Events

After trading:  
Open Rules vs Reality Dashboard.  
Filter for news-rule violations or trades tagged with news-window context.  
For each trade, review which event it was near, emotions, conviction, and outcome.  
Over time, this reveals patterns such as:  
"Pre-news entries are low-conviction and often FOMO."  
"News-window trades have worse slippage and worse R:R."  
"News violations frequently start multi-rule violation cascades."

## Why It Matters for Challenge Traders

For prop firm challenges and funded accounts, news guardrails are especially important:  
Preventing account blowouts – High-impact events can cause large spikes and slippage that exceed daily loss limits.  
Reducing slippage – News windows are where stop fills are most unreliable.  
Aligning with prop firm rules – Many firms explicitly restrict news trading.  
Creating predictable routines – You know in advance which hours are "off limits."

## Limitations and Clarifications

High-Impact Only (by design) – Calendar is curated to major events only.  
No forecasts/actuals/sentiment – Use external calendars if you need those.  
Depends on your timezone setting – Incorrect timezone settings will make windows and violation timing inaccurate.  
Not synced with broker calendars – Broker-specific restrictions/holidays are not automatically mirrored.  
Scheduled times only – The system uses scheduled release times; it does not adjust for delays.  
Rules are not retroactive – Adding a news-based rule today does not re-label old trades.
