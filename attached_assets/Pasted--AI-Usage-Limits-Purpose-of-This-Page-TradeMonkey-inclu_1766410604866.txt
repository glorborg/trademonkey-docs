# AI Usage Limits

## Purpose of This Page

TradeMonkey includes several AI-powered features. These features have daily usage limits to ensure consistent performance, fair access, and system stability.

This page explains what AI limits are, how they work, and where you can view your usage.

Important:  
AI limits apply only to AI-powered features. Core journaling, analytics, rule tracking, trade entry, and reflections are always unlimited.

## What AI Limits Are

AI usage limits are daily quotas that define how many times each AI feature can be used within a 24-hour cycle.

Limits vary depending on your current subscription, and the official pricing page is the source of truth for the latest quotas.

## AI Features With Daily Limits

The following AI tools have daily limits:

AI Diagnostics  
Generates a clinical summary of recent execution patterns.  
One use = generating a diagnostics report.

AI Deep Dive Explorer  
Structured, multi-step pattern exploration.  
One use = each follow-up or new exploration step.

Rules Coach  
Helps clarify and define actionable trading rules.  
One use = each AI interaction inside a coaching session.

Reflection Analysis  
AI interpretation of written reflections.  
One use = analyzing a reflection.

Trade Thread AI  
Summaries of the full trade lifecycle.  
One use = generating a thread summary. Cached results do not consume quota.

## Features That Are Not Limited

All core TradeMonkey functionality remains unlimited:

Manual trade entry  
CSV imports (subject to per-import limits shown on pricing page)  
Rule creation and rule evaluations  
Psychology logging (emotions, conviction, adherence)  
Writing reflections and journal entries  
Behavioral Recaps  
Time-Scoped Analytics  
Tags and tag-based filtering  
Calendar & news guardrails  
Viewing dashboards and analytics  
Viewing past AI outputs that were already generated

AI usage limits affect only the production of new AI-generated insights.

## Why Limits Exist

Daily limits exist to:

Ensure stable and predictable performance for all users  
Keep the system resilient to misuse or rapid-fire requests  
Maintain sustainable operation of AI features  
Encourage intentional use of AI-generated insights  
Discourage analysis paralysis

Limits help keep the product accessible while ensuring consistency across the user base.

## How Limits Reset

AI limits reset once per day at midnight UTC.

When the reset occurs:

All AI feature quotas return to full  
Any features that reached their limit become available again  
Your local time equivalent is displayed anywhere limits are shown.

## Where You Can See Your Usage

You can view AI usage and remaining quota in:

Each AI Feature Page  
Inline display showing:

How many uses you've consumed  
How many remain  
When the quota resets

2. Settings → Usage  
A consolidated overview showing:

Your current subscription's limits  
Today's usage for each AI feature  
The next reset time

3. Limit Reached Messages  
When a limit is exhausted, the feature becomes temporarily unavailable and displays a clear reset time.

## What Happens When You Hit a Limit

The specific AI feature becomes unavailable until the next reset.  
All core reflections, analytics, and rule-tracking features remain fully accessible.  
You can continue working normally; only AI-generated insights pause temporarily.

## Plan-Specific Limits

Different subscription levels may include different quotas.  
For current limits, always refer to the pricing page, as plan inclusions can change over time.

This document does not list plan names or numbers.
