# Data Import & Export

## Purpose

TradeMonkey supports importing historical trades via CSV and exporting your data at any time. This enables fast onboarding with past trading activity and full portability of your journal.

This page summarizes **how imports work**, **what formats are supported**, and **how to export your data** without exposing internal implementation details.

# Importing Data

TradeMonkey supports two CSV import methods:

1. **Template Import** – Use TradeMonkey’s CSV template.  
2. **Broker-Mapped Import** – Upload any broker CSV and map its columns to TradeMonkey fields.

Both methods validate data before import and only apply changes to your own account.

## Template Import

### How to Use

1. Go to **Settings → Accounts → [Select Account] → Import Trades**.  
2. Download the template CSV.  
3. Fill in your trades using the required fields:
   - **symbol**  
   - **side** (buy/sell)  
   - **entry_time**, **entry_price**  
   - **exit_time**, **exit_price**  
   - **pnl** *or* **closing_balance** (one is required)

4. Upload the CSV and review the preview screen.  
5. Confirm import.

TradeMonkey validates rows for required fields, date formats, numeric fields, and logical consistency (e.g., exit_time must be after entry_time).

If errors exist, the system will flag specific rows so you can correct and re-upload.

## Broker-Mapped Import

If you export trades directly from your broker (MT5, cTrader, TradingView, etc.), you can import the file without changing it.

### Steps

1. Upload your broker CSV.  
2. Map each column to the correct TradeMonkey field (e.g., “Open Time” → entry_time).  
3. Choose how P&L should be interpreted:
   - Use a **P&L column**, or  
   - Derive P&L from a **closing balance** column  
4. Review the preview and confirm.

This method allows flexibility when broker CSV formats differ.

## Import Tips

- Dates must use a clear timestamp format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`).  
- Decimal numbers must use a period (`.`).  
- Empty values can be left blank.  
- If the CSV includes both `pnl` and `closing_balance`, TradeMonkey prioritizes direct P&L.  
- The preview screen must be reviewed before imports can be finalized.

# Reconciliation (Manual + CSV)

If you manually log trades during the session and later import broker-confirmed CSVs, TradeMonkey will attempt to **match** them using:

- symbol  
- side  
- entry time (within an allowed time window)

If matched, the system merges psychology data (from your manual entry) with financial data (from CSV).  
If no match is found, the CSV trade is imported normally and can be updated later.

# Exporting Data

You can export your data at any time.

### Available Exports

- **Trades (CSV)** – Includes symbols, timestamps, prices, P&L, psychology fields, notes, tags.  
- **Journal Entries (CSV)** – Includes all reflections and optional AI summaries.  
- **Trading Rules (CSV)** – Includes rule details and status.

### How to Export

1. Go to **Settings → Data & Privacy → Export Data**  
2. Select what you want to export  
3. Download the generated CSV file

There are no limits on export frequency or file size (browser performance may vary for large files).
