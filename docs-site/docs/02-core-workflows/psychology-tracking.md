# Drift Detection

## Purpose

Drift Detection identifies behavioral and execution drift across your trades.

It analyzes how your emotional state, conviction, and plan adherence correlate with actual outcomes over time, and surfaces repeatable patterns — both strengths and risk areas — without coaching or judgment.

This view exists to answer one question:

Where does my execution reliably hold — and where does it drift?

## What Drift Detection Analyzes

Drift Detection works by aggregating recorded behavior across many trades and comparing it to results.

## Emotional State Patterns

TradeMonkey analyzes the emotional tags you recorded at entry and exit, such as:

Calm, Confident

Fear, FOMO, Greed, Revenge

Regret, Frustration, Relief, Satisfaction

Emotions can be combined (e.g. Confident + Impatient, Fear + Calm) to reflect how you actually felt.

Drift Detection then evaluates:

Win rate and P&L by emotional state

Which emotions correlate with stability vs degradation

Which emotional combinations tend to precede drift

## Conviction Patterns (1–10)

Conviction scores are evaluated across trades:

Entry conviction — how strong the setup felt when you entered

Exit conviction — how confident you were when closing

Drift Detection highlights:

Performance by conviction level

Conviction gaps (exit minus entry)

Situations where conviction reliably collapses or holds

This surfaces confidence erosion patterns, not opinions.

## Plan Adherence vs Outcome

Drift Detection compares outcomes based on how closely you followed your plan:

Followed

Partial

Not followed

This makes it possible to see, in aggregate:

How execution quality affects results

Where discretionary behavior consistently helps or hurts

## What Drift Detection Produces

Drift Detection outputs are descriptive signals, not instructions.

Strengths

Patterns where your execution shows consistency, stability, or edge  
(e.g. "When calm and confident, win rate remains elevated.")

Areas to Watch

Patterns where drift or degradation appears  
(e.g. "Rule violations increase after conviction drops.")

Detected Patterns

AI-assisted summaries that highlight repeatable behavioral correlations across your selected time range.

All findings follow the same format:

When X behavior appears, Y outcome tends to follow.

## How Drift Detection Fits Into the System

Drift Detection pulls from:

Emotional state

Conviction

Plan adherence

Rule outcomes

Trade results

It then feeds insight into:

Behavioral Recap (single-trade context)

Threads (timeline evidence)

Rules vs Reality

AI Diagnostics and Deep Dive tools (optional)

Think of Drift Detection as the wide-angle lens, while Threads and Recaps provide the close-up footage.

## How to Use Drift Detection

Choose a time scope

Select the range you want to analyze:

Last N trades

Recent days or weeks

All time

Custom range

Review high-level signals first

Start with:

Net P&L

Win rate

Profit factor

Average trade

These anchor interpretation in outcomes, not feelings.

Scan strengths and risk areas

Review:

Strengths worth protecting

Areas where drift begins to appear

Patterns that repeat across multiple trades

Use filters (execution, rules, AI analysis) to isolate specific dimensions.

Drill down when needed

When a pattern stands out:

Click through to related trades

Open Behavioral Recaps or Threads

Review the underlying events and context

Drift Detection points to where to look, not what to change.

## Important Notes

Drift Detection is descriptive, not prescriptive.  
It shows correlations between behavior and outcome. Interpretation and correction remain yours.

Signal quality improves with volume.  
Reliable patterns emerge over dozens of trades, not a handful.

Consistency beats precision.  
Simple, honest tagging produces clearer signals than overthinking.

All data comes from what you log.  
No emotions or conviction → no behavioral signal.

AI features are optional.  
Core drift detection works without AI; AI enhances pattern surfacing when used.
