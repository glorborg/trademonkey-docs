# Psychology Tracking

## Purpose

Psychology Tracking records your mental state at key decision points in a trade. It links how you felt and how confident you were to how you executed and what the outcome was. The goal is to surface factual patterns, not to judge or coach you.

## What Psychology Tracking Captures

### Emotions

You can tag up to a few emotions at **entry** and **exit**, for example:

- Confident, Calm
- Fear, FOMO, Revenge, Greed
- Relief, Regret, Pride, Frustration, Satisfied

You can combine emotions (e.g. *Confident + Impatient*, *Fear + Calm*) to better describe how you actually felt.

### Conviction (1–10 Scale)

You rate your confidence at:

- **Entry conviction** – how strong the setup felt when you entered.
- **Exit conviction** – how confident you were in the exit decision.

The difference between them (exit minus entry) is the **conviction gap**, which helps you see when confidence holds, erodes, or strengthens during a trade.

### Plan Adherence

At entry and exit you mark whether you followed your trading plan:

- **Yes** – followed the plan.
- **Partial** – mostly followed, with minor deviation.
- **No** – off-plan or impulsive.

This makes it easy to compare performance when you did versus didn't follow your own rules.

## How TradeMonkey Uses This Data

Psychology data feeds into several views and analytics:

- **Performance by emotion**  
  Win rate and P&L by entry and exit emotions (e.g. FOMO vs Calm vs Confident).

- **Performance by conviction**  
  Results grouped by conviction levels and by conviction gap (how often conviction collapses before you exit).

- **Plan adherence vs outcome**  
  How trades perform when adherence is Yes vs Partial vs No.

- **Time-based trends**  
  Changes in conviction, emotions, and adherence by session or date range.

- **Threads, Trade Recap, and AI features**  
  Emotions, conviction, and adherence appear inside Threads and Trade Recap, and are used by AI summaries and deep-dive tools to highlight behavioral patterns. AI usage and features may be limited by subscription level; see the pricing page for current details.

All outputs are descriptive: "When you felt X with conviction Y, your trades tended to do Z." You decide what those patterns mean and what to change.

## How to Use Psychology Tracking

1. **At entry**
   - Tag your entry emotions.
   - Set an entry conviction score (1–10).
   - Mark entry plan adherence (Yes / Partial / No).
   - Optionally add a short note explaining why you took the trade.

2. **At exit**
   - Tag your exit emotions.
   - Set an exit conviction score (1–10).
   - Mark exit plan adherence.
   - Optionally add a note explaining why you closed.

3. **During reviews**
   - Go to Psychology or analytics views to:
     - Compare performance by emotion and conviction.
     - Spot conviction gaps and plan adherence breakdowns.
     - Filter by session, date range, or account to see where patterns cluster.

4. **With AI (optional)**
   - Use AI summaries or deep-dive tools on trades or time ranges where you want more behavioral insight. These tools work best when emotions, conviction, and adherence are logged consistently.

## Important Notes

- Psychology tracking is **optional**. Core journaling, rules, and analytics work even if you never log emotions or conviction.
- Patterns become reliable only after you have enough trades logged (dozens, not just a few).
- Consistency and honesty matter more than perfection. It is better to log simple, truthful tags than to overthink them.
- TradeMonkey describes correlations; it does not tell you what you "should" do next.
- Plan, feature, and AI limits may vary by subscription. For current details, see the pricing page.
