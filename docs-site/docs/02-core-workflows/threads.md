# Threads (Life of a Trade)

## Purpose

Threads are the behavior timeline for a single trade.

They show the chronological record of what actually occurred — from trade creation and entry state, through execution and rule checks, to exit and post-trade reflection.

If Behavioral Recap is the condensed replay, Threads are the raw dashcam footage.

## What Threads Show

Each thread is a timestamped sequence of events tied to one trade. Events are displayed in the order they occurred and preserved as a factual record.

## Entry Events

Trade creation (symbol, side, account)

Entry price, size, and time

Entry emotional state and conviction (1–10)

Entry plan adherence

Entry notes and screenshots (if added)

This captures what you saw and felt at the moment of commitment.

## Mid-Trade Events

Notes or reflections added while the trade is open

Rule evaluations and violations as they occur

Additional screenshots or observations

Visible psychological shifts (e.g., doubt, hesitation, FOMO, frustration)

These events show how execution and psychology evolved while the trade was live.

## Exit Events

Exit time, price, and realized P&L

Exit emotional state and conviction

Exit plan adherence

Exit notes and screenshots

This marks how and why the trade was closed, not just the outcome.

## Post-Trade Events

Reflections added minutes, hours, or days later

Optional AI-generated summaries or analyses (when you choose to run them)

Post-trade entries are clearly timestamped so you can distinguish in-the-moment behavior from later interpretation.

## Threads vs Behavioral Recap

Behavioral Recap  
A summarized, single-page replay designed for scanning and comparison across trades.

Threads  
The full event-by-event timeline for one trade, showing exactly how it unfolded over time.

Use Recap to spot drift.  
Use Threads to understand it.

## How to Use Threads

Open a thread

From Trades or Behavioral Recap, open a trade and switch to the Thread tab.

Read the timeline top to bottom

Threads are chronological by design.

Scroll through the events in order and pay attention to timestamps to see:

When decisions were made

When emotions or conviction shifted

When rules were evaluated or violated

Review the entry context

Confirm entry price, SL/TP, emotions, conviction, and plan adherence

Review entry screenshots and notes to see what you acted on

Observe mid-trade behavior

Read notes added while the trade was open

View rule violations in the exact context they occurred

Compare screenshots across different moments in the trade

This is often where behavioral drift becomes visible.

Understand the exit

Identify whether the exit was planned or discretionary

Compare planned vs actual exit levels

Review exit emotions and conviction to see whether confidence held or collapsed

Add post-trade reflections

You can append reflections after the trade to capture:

Lessons learned

Behavioral patterns you notice

What you would want to recognize earlier next time

Later reflections never overwrite earlier events — they sit alongside them.

Optionally analyze the full thread with AI

For important trades (large wins/losses, emotional trades, rule violations), you can analyze the entire trade thread.

When used:

AI scans the full event timeline, emotions, conviction, notes, and rule outcomes

It surfaces behavioral patterns and execution signals

AI usage is optional and subject to limits based on your plan

When Threads Are Most Useful

Investigating a specific rule violation

Understanding why conviction collapsed mid-trade

Reviewing emotionally charged trades

Preparing for deeper analysis or AI Deep Dive

Building accurate self-awareness about execution habits

## Important Notes

Threads are append-focused and chronological.  
Events are timestamped and preserved to maintain an accurate sequence.

Threads document behavior — they do not prescribe action.  
Once behavioral drift is visible, correction becomes possible.

Thread quality depends on what you log.  
Emotions, conviction, notes, and screenshots make the timeline far more informative than P&L alone.

Threads are private by default.  
Any future sharing or accountability features will be strictly opt-in.

Threads complement, not replace, other views.  
Use analytics and dashboards for patterns across trades; use Threads to understand individual trades in depth.
