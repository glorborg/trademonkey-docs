# Open Office Hours

## What Are Open Office Hours?

Open Office Hours are a live, weekly working session with the TradeMonkey team.  
They are not webinars, sales calls, or presentations.  
They are an open forum where traders bring real data, real questions, and real execution scenarios and work through them in context.  
If you use TradeMonkey, Open Office Hours are where the system becomes clearer, faster.

## When Do They Happen?

Open Office Hours are held weekly.  
The current day, time, and access details are always listed in the Help & Docs section inside the app so you don't have to hunt for links or remember schedules.

## What Happens During a Session?

Typical Open Office Hours include:

Walking through actual TradeMonkey screens

Reviewing Behavioral Recaps or Threads (with permission)

Clarifying how rules, reconciliation, or drift detection works

Answering workflow questions (logging, imports, reviews)

Helping you interpret what you're seeing in your own data

There's no fixed agenda.  
The session follows what participants bring in.

## What Open Office Hours Are Not

To set expectations clearly:

Not trade signals

Not strategy coaching

Not motivational talks

Not recorded marketing demos

The focus is on execution clarity, not persuasion.

## Why Attend?

Most traders don't struggle because they lack information.  
They struggle because they misread their own execution.

Open Office Hours help you:

See your data the way the system sees it

Remove ambiguity around rules and reconciliation

Spot drift faster by reviewing real examples

Avoid common usage mistakes early

Build confidence that you're using the platform correctly

Many users find that one session replaces weeks of second-guessing.

## Who Should Attend?

Open Office Hours are especially useful if:

You're new and want to set things up correctly

Something in your data "feels off" but you can't pinpoint why

You want to sanity-check how you're reviewing trades

You're starting to see patterns and want to confirm them

You prefer live clarification over guessing or rereading docs

You don't need to prepare slides or questions in advance.  
You can listen, ask, or just observe.

## How to Join

Open the Help & Docs section in the app

Look for Open Office Hours

Join using the listed link at the scheduled time

That's it.

## Final Note

Open Office Hours exist for one reason:  
Clarity compounds.  
The better you understand your execution and the tools you're using to observe it, the faster everything else simplifies.
