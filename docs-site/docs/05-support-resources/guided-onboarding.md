# Guided Onboarding

## Why Guided Onboarding Exists

TradeMonkey is not a "plug-and-play" tool — and that's intentional.  
It's designed to observe execution, not just store trades.  
Guided Onboarding exists to help you set things up once, correctly, so what you see later is clear, reliable, and grounded in reality.  
Most confusion later in the platform traces back to skipped onboarding steps.  
Completing onboarding prevents that.

## What Guided Onboarding Walks You Through

Guided Onboarding is a short, structured process inside the app that helps you establish a clean foundation.  
It typically includes:

Creating your first Trading Account

Setting your time zone correctly

Defining basic rules you want evaluated

Importing broker data to establish a financial baseline

Understanding how behavior logging and reconciliation work together

Seeing where Threads, Behavioral Recap, and Drift Detection fit in the workflow

You are not expected to optimize anything during onboarding.  
The goal is alignment, not perfection.

## How to Approach Onboarding

Move through onboarding in order.  
Each step builds on the last:

Behavior is logged first

Financial truth is reconciled second

Patterns emerge only after both exist

Trying to "skip ahead" usually leads to missing signals or misread data later.

If something doesn't make sense during onboarding, that's normal.  
Clarity comes quickly once the pieces are in place.

## What Happens After Onboarding

Once onboarding is complete, TradeMonkey begins functioning as intended:

Trades have behavioral context

Rules evaluate against real outcomes

Analytics stabilize over time

Drift becomes visible instead of vague

From here, your role is simple:

Log honestly

Reconcile periodically

Review after the fact

Everything else builds naturally.

## If You Skip Onboarding

You can still use TradeMonkey, but you may notice:

Rules being skipped

Analytics showing limited insight

Drift Detection lacking signal

Data that feels incomplete or confusing

This isn't a system failure — it's usually a setup gap.  
Guided Onboarding exists to remove that friction.

## Need Extra Help?

If you want help beyond Guided Onboarding, you have two easy options:

Use in-app support  
Ask questions directly inside the app during live support hours.

Attend the next Open Office Hours  
Bring your setup, your data, or your questions.  
Many users find one session resolves onboarding uncertainty immediately.

Current Open Office Hours times and access links are listed in the Help & Docs section of the app.

## Final Note

Guided Onboarding is not a test.  
It's a shortcut.  
The faster your foundation is clear, the faster execution stops being noisy — and starts being understandable.
