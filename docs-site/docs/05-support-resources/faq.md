# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Is TradeMonkey telling me how to trade?
No.
TradeMonkey does not generate trade ideas, signals, or instructions.
 It records what you did, how you felt, and what the outcome was.
It functions as a behavior dashcam, not a coach.
If you want advice, you decide where to get it.
 TradeMonkey's role is to make your execution visible.

## Why doesn't TradeMonkey tell me what I should do next?
Because behavior only changes reliably after it's clearly seen.
TradeMonkey is intentionally non-prescriptive.
 It shows patterns, drift, and correlations — not directives.
Once execution drift is visible, most traders correct it without being told.

## Do I need to log emotions and reflections for this to work?
You can use TradeMonkey without reflections, but you'll only get financial analytics.
Behavioral insight requires behavioral data.
If you don't log:
Emotions


Conviction


Plan adherence


Then the system has nothing to correlate execution against.
In short:
No reflections → P&L only


Consistent reflections → execution insight

## What if I forget to log a trade or reflection?
That's normal.
TradeMonkey is built around reconciliation, not perfection.
You can:
Import broker CSVs later to establish financial truth


Add reflections after the fact if you want to complete the record


The system does not punish gaps — it simply shows what data exists and what doesn't.
Missing data is itself a signal.

## Why do I need to import broker CSVs if I already logged trades?
Because memory ≠ reality.
Live logging captures intent and psychology.
 Broker CSVs capture what actually happened financially.
Importing CSVs reconciles the two:
Preserves your behavioral record


Corrects prices, timing, and P&L to broker truth


This is what allows rules, analytics, and drift detection to be grounded in reality.

## What happens if my logged trade doesn't match the broker data?
TradeMonkey defers to broker-confirmed outcomes for financial fields.
Your:
Emotions


Conviction


Notes


Rule intent


Are preserved exactly as logged.
This separation is intentional:
Behavior is recorded as experienced.
 Outcomes are reconciled as executed.

## Can I change or delete reflections later?
You can add new reflections at any time.
 Earlier events remain timestamped and preserved.
TradeMonkey is designed to show sequence, not revisionist history.
Later insight does not overwrite earlier behavior — it sits alongside it.

## What if I don't want to use AI features?
That's fine.
All core tracking, rules, and analytics work without AI.
AI features:
Are optional


Run only when you explicitly request them


Summarize patterns already present in your data


Nothing is sent automatically.

## Does TradeMonkey judge or grade my trading?
No.
TradeMonkey does not label trades as "good" or "bad."
It describes correlations such as:
When X behavior appears, Y outcome tends to follow.


Interpretation and decisions remain yours.

## Is this just journaling with extra steps?
No.
Journaling captures narrative.
 TradeMonkey captures structured behavioral evidence.
The difference:
Journals are read


Dashcam footage is replayed and compared


TradeMonkey turns subjective experience into data that can be analyzed across time.

## What if I don't like what I see?
That's usually the point where progress begins.
TradeMonkey doesn't force change.
 It removes ambiguity.
Most traders don't need motivation — they need clear feedback they can't rationalize away.

## Who is TradeMonkey actually for?
TradeMonkey is for traders who:
Want to understand execution under pressure


Are willing to look at their own behavior honestly


Prefer clarity over comfort


It's not for traders looking for:
Signals


Shortcuts


External blame

## What's the "right" way to use TradeMonkey?
There isn't one.
But the pattern that works best for most users is:
Log trades and behavior close to execution


Import broker data periodically to reconcile outcomes


Review Recaps and Threads after the fact


Use Drift Detection to spot repeat patterns


Decide what (if anything) to change


TradeMonkey shows the evidence.
 You decide what to do with it.
