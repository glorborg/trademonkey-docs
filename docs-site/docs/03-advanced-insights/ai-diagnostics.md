# AI Diagnostics

## Purpose

AI Diagnostics scans your recent trades and gives you a single, objective report of the main patterns in your trading behavior. It focuses on how emotions, conviction, rules, and outcomes interact and impact your trades— without coaching or advice.

## What This Feature Does

AI Diagnostics:

Reviews your closed trades over a chosen window (for example, your recent trades or last month).

Analyzes emotions, conviction scores, plan adherence, rule violations, and outcomes.

Highlights key patterns such as:

Which emotions tend to be expensive.

Where conviction collapses during execution.

When and how rules are most often broken.

Time-of-day or session-based performance differences.

Setup or tag types that consistently underperform.

Produces a short, structured report you can read in one pass.

The report is descriptive only. It shows correlations and patterns but does not tell you what to do.

## How to Use It

Make sure you have a reasonable number of recent trades logged with emotions, conviction, and plan adherence.

Open the AI Diagnostics section in the app.

Choose the time scope or trade range you want analyzed (for example, last 30 days or last 50 trades).

Run AI Diagnostics.

Read the report and note which patterns matter most to you.

If needed, use other features (like Deep Dive Explorer, Trade Thread Summary, or Rules Coach) to explore specific patterns further or tighten your rules.

## Important Notes and Limits

AI Diagnostics works best when most trades have:

Entry/exit emotions

Entry/exit conviction scores

Plan Adherence marked

It analyzes the trades in your current time scope (for example, last 30 days vs. all time). Always check which filter is active before you run it.

Results are correlations, not guarantees:

"FOMO trades lost money historically" does not mean the next FOMO trade will lose.

Use the report as a "recording" of your behavior, not as a signal.

Only AI features are rate-limited. Limits reset daily and may vary by subscription level. Core tracking, rules, and analytics continue to work even if you reach AI limits.

If you hit a limit, you'll see an in-app message and can run diagnostics again after the reset.

Past AI Diagnostic reports remain visible so you can review or compare them later.

AI can occasionally misread patterns. If something looks off, cross-check it against the Behavioral Recap and Rules vs Reality pages.
