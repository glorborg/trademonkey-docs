# AI Deep Dive Explorer

## Purpose

AI Deep Dive Explorer is a conversational analysis tool that helps you understand **why** specific patterns show up in your trading. It builds on top of your existing analytics and lets you drill into one pattern at a time through focused follow-up questions.

## What This Feature Does

AI Deep Dive Explorer:

- Uses your trading journal data (P&L, emotions, conviction, plan adherence, rules, tags, timing) to analyze one pattern of your choice.
- Answers questions like:
  - "Why does my conviction drop during trades?"
  - "When is FOMO most expensive for me?"
  - "Under what conditions does my discipline break down?"
- Lets you ask a short chain of follow-up questions so each answer gets more specific.
- Stays descriptive: it shows correlations and conditions, but does not give advice or tell you what to do.

## How to Use It

1. **Spot a pattern**  
   Use AI Diagnostics, Time-Scoped Analytics, Execution Recap, or Rules vs Reality to find something interesting (for example, "afternoon trades underperform" or "FOMO is costly").

2. **Start a Deep Dive**  
   Open AI Deep Dive Explorer and ask a clear, data-based question:
   - "Why do my afternoon trades perform worse than morning trades?"
   - "What conditions appear most often in my revenge trades?"

3. **Ask follow-ups**  
   Use the answers to go deeper:
   - Compare times of day, emotions, conviction levels, rule violations, tags, or accounts.
   - Keep each follow-up tied to the previous answer ("Does this happen more after losses?" rather than changing topic completely).

4. **Capture insights**  
   When you see a pattern that matters (for example, "afternoon + low conviction + FOMO after losses is my worst combo"), write it down or save the transcript.

5. **Decide what to do next**  
   Use your own judgment to adjust rules, sessions, or strategy. Deep Dive shows you the mirror; you decide on the response.

## What Data It Uses

Deep Dive Explorer works on **aggregated, structured data** from your journal, such as:

- Win rate and P&L by:
  - Emotion
  - Conviction range
  - Time of day / session
  - Tag / setup type
  - Rule adherence vs violation
- Conviction gaps (entry vs exit) and how they relate to outcomes.
- Rule violation patterns (when and where they cluster).
- Multi-factor combinations (for example, "afternoon + low conviction + FOMO + after losses").

It **does not**:

- Read or interpret your free-text notes or reflections.
- Analyze screenshots or charts.
- Know external market conditions, news, or broker details.
- Provide personal, psychological, or trading advice.

## Important Notes and Limits

- Deep Dive is **pattern-specific**: it does not scan your whole history on its own. Start from a pattern you've already noticed.
- It respects your current time scope where applicable (for example, Last 30 Days vs All Time), so check your filters before starting.
- Results are **correlations, not guarantees**:
  - "Afternoon FOMO trades lost money historically" does **not** mean the next one must lose.
- Deep Dive is **descriptive, not prescriptive**:
  - It will say "FOMO trades have 22% win rate vs 58% for non-FOMO"  
  - It will **not** say "Stop trading FOMO setups."
- There are **daily usage limits** and each exploration is capped to a small number of follow-up questions to keep the system fast and stable. Limits may vary by subscription level; if you hit a limit you'll see an in-app message and can try again after the reset.
- Past Deep Dive sessions can be revisited, but if you want to keep them permanently, copy notes or save transcripts outside TradeMonkey.
- Deep Dive does not replace manual review. Use it alongside Psychology, Rules vs Reality, Execution Recap, and Trade Recap to validate what you see.
