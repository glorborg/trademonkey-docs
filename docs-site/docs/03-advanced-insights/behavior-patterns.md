# Behavior Patterns

## Purpose

Behavior patterns are recurring behaviors in your trading that show up across many trades, not just one. They connect your psychology, Rule Adherence, and outcomes to answer:

"What do I tend to do over and over, when executing my trading plan, and what does it usually lead to?"

## What This Feature Does

Behavior patterns combine multiple parts of your data:

Psychology – Emotional State, Conviction (1–10) scores, Plan Adherence.  
Compliance – which rules you follow or break.  
Outcomes – win rate, P&L, risk-reward.  
Timing – time of day, session, day of week.  
Context – tags (setups, strategies, accounts, etc.).

From this, TradeMonkey surfaces stable, recurring tendencies, for example:

"After an opening loss, you often exceed your daily trade limit."  
"FOMO-tagged trades have much lower win rate than your baseline."  
"Afternoon trades show lower Conviction (1–10) and lower Plan Adherence than morning trades."

Behavior patterns are descriptive, not rules. Rules are things you set ("Max 3 trades per day"). Patterns are things the system observes ("On days with a first-trade loss, you frequently trade more than 3 times").

## Where You'll See Behavior Patterns

Behavior patterns power several parts of the app:

AI Diagnostics  
Uses your data to highlight the most important patterns in a single report (for example, emotional cost, conviction decay, time-of-day effects).

AI Deep Dive Explorer  
Starts from a known pattern ("conviction drops during drawdowns") and lets you ask follow-up questions to see when, where, and under what conditions it's strongest.

Rules vs Reality Dashboard  
Shows rule-driven patterns (for example, which rules you break after a loss, or which sessions have more violations).

Time-Scoped Analytics  
Compares patterns across time windows (for example, "Last 30 days" vs "All time") to show whether behaviors are improving, stable, or drifting.

Behavioral Recap  
Lets you visually confirm patterns across multiple trades (screenshots, Emotional State, Conviction (1–10), exits).

You won't see a "Patterns" tab by name; instead, patterns appear as clinical statements embedded in these views listed above.

## How to Get Meaningful Behavior Patterns in Your Trading Behavioral Data

Log complete data  
Record Emotional State, Conviction (1–10), Plan Adherence, and tags along with each trade at the time you placed the trade.  
The more complete your data, the more reliable the patterns.

Run your usual reviews  
Use Time-Scoped Analytics, Rules vs Reality, and AI Diagnostics for weekly or monthly reviews.  
Let the system surface patterns instead of hunting manually.

Read pattern statements carefully  
Focus on what the pattern is, when it shows up, and how it differs from your rules and trading plan.  
Prioritize patterns with clear impact (large P&L differences, strong win-rate gaps, frequent rule violations).

Drill deeper when needed  
Use AI Deep Dive Explorer when a pattern looks important (for example, FOMO, afternoon performance, post-loss behavior).  
Ask follow-up questions like "When is this strongest?" or "What conditions usually surround this?"

Decide what it means for you  
TradeMonkey reflects what happened; it does not tell you what to change.  
Use patterns to inform adjustments to your rules, schedule, sizing, or strategies in other parts of your trading playbook.

## Example Pattern Statements

You might see statements like:

"Trades entered after 2 PM show lower Plan Adherence and worse average P&L than morning trades."  
"FOMO-tagged entries have significantly lower win rate and worse risk-reward than your overall average."  
"On days where your first trade is a loss, your daily trade-count rule is broken far more often than on winning-start days."  
"High-conviction entries correlate with better outcomes and higher adherence across setups."

All of these operate as a behavior dashcam: they document what occurred, not what you should do next. Once behavioral drift becomes visible, correction becomes possible.

## Important Notes and Limits

Needs enough data  
Patterns only appear once there are enough trades and repeated situations. Very small samples may be hidden or clearly marked as "limited data."

Data quality matters  
Missing Emotional State, Conviction (1–10), or tags reduce what can be detected. Incomplete fields lead to weaker or fewer patterns.

Descriptive, not prescriptive  
Patterns say "what tends to happen," not "what you must do." Any changes you make are your own decisions.

Correlation ≠ causation  
If FOMO trades underperform, that's a correlation. The system cannot know whether emotion itself, market conditions, or something else is driving the result.

Past ≠ guaranteed future  
Patterns are based on past trades. They show tendencies, not guarantees about upcoming trades.

## Support

If a pattern looks wrong or confusing, you can always cross-check it with your raw analytics. For help understanding what you're seeing, contact [hello@trademonkey.app](mailto:hello@trademonkey.app).
