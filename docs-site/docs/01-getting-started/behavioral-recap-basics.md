# Behavioral Recap

## Purpose

Behavioral Recap is a visual review workspace that shows each trade as a before/after snapshot. It combines your charts, Emotional State, Conviction (1–10), Plan Adherence, and P&L so you can see how you traded, not just what the result was.

The goal is pattern detection: spotting repeatable execution habits that are hard to see in spreadsheets or raw P&L.

## What Behavioral Recap Shows

For each trade, Recap can display:

Entry context  
Entry chart screenshot (if provided)  
Entry emotions (Emotional State)  
Entry conviction score (Conviction (1–10))  
Entry plan adherence (Yes / Partial / No) (Plan Adherence)

Exit context  
Exit chart screenshot (if provided)  
Exit emotions (Emotional State)  
Exit conviction score (Conviction (1–10))  
Exit plan adherence (Plan Adherence)

Financial context  
P&L for the trade  
Win/Loss status  
Entry/exit prices and timestamps

Screenshots are optional. If they are missing, you still see the psychological and financial data.

## How to Use Behavioral Recap

Filter the trades you want to review  
By date range (e.g., this week, this month)  
By account (e.g., a specific challenge)  
By Emotional State (e.g., FOMO, revenge, fear)  
By P&L (e.g., biggest wins/losses)

Review the entry side  
Look at the entry screenshot (if available).  
Check entry emotions (Emotional State), conviction (Conviction (1–10)), and adherence (Plan Adherence).  
Ask: does the chart support the conviction score and "Yes"/"No" adherence (Plan Adherence) you logged?

Review the exit side  
Look at the exit screenshot.  
Check exit emotions (Emotional State), conviction (Conviction (1–10)), and adherence (Plan Adherence).  
Ask: did you exit where you planned (stop/target), or did you cut early, chase, or panic?

Compare P&L to execution quality  
Identify:  
Good execution, good result  
Good execution, bad result (acceptable loss)  
Poor execution, good result (lucky win)  
Poor execution, bad result

Write down recurring patterns  
Examples:  
Conviction starts high and collapses on small pullbacks.  
Afternoon trades show lower conviction and more plan violations.  
FOMO-tagged trades cluster around high-volatility spikes and news.  
Trades after a loss show more impulsive entries and lower-quality setups.

These notes become hypotheses you can verify later in time-scoped analytics and AI tools.

## What Patterns Recap Helps Reveal

Common patterns traders notice:

Conviction decay  
Strong entry conviction, weak exit conviction.  
Frequent early exits during normal volatility instead of at planned levels.

Session-based deterioration  
Morning trades show cleaner setups and higher adherence.  
Later trades show more cluttered charts, lower conviction, and more impulsive decisions.

Emotion-result links  
FOMO or impatience at entry correlates with choppy price action and poor outcomes.  
Calm or patient entries correlate with more structured setups.

Revenge clusters  
Losing trades followed by fast sequences of lower-conviction trades with "revenge" or "frustration" emotions.

Recap does not tell you what to change. It shows you where your behavior is different from what you believe you are doing.

## Screenshots: Optional but Powerful

You can use Recap without screenshots  
You'll still see emotions, conviction, adherence, and P&L.

Screenshots add the most value when:  
Reviewing big wins/losses or challenge accounts.  
Studying repeated rule violations (e.g., early exits, chasing entries).  
You're actively trying to understand your execution on a specific setup or session.

You don't need screenshots for every trade  
Many traders use a hybrid approach: screenshots for the most instructive trades, psychology and P&L only for the rest.

## Important Notes

Recap relies on the reflection data you log (Emotional State, Conviction (1–10), Plan Adherence). Without it, you see only price and P&L.

Patterns are descriptive, not prescriptive. Recap does not recommend rules or strategies; it reflects what you actually did.

Your interpretation is subjective. Use Recap together with other views (Rules vs Reality, time-scoped analytics, AI insights) to validate what you think you're seeing.

Reviewing trades soon after they happen gives more accurate context than reviewing them months later.
