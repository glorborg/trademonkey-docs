TradeMonkey is an execution mirror for traders.

Instead of working like a traditional journal—where you reconstruct trades after the fact—TradeMonkey captures your **intentions**, **emotional state**, **risk decisions**, and **rule boundaries** *as they occur*. This removes hindsight bias and creates an accurate, objective record of your execution behavior.

TradeMonkey reflects these gaps back to you clinically, through three primary lenses:

---

## The Three Lenses of the Execution Mirror

### **1. Plan vs Execution**

Compares what you *intended* to do with what you *actually* did.

TradeMonkey captures:

- Planned risk vs actual risk  
- Planned stop vs actual exit  
- Planned target vs realized R:R  
- Whether you followed your execution plan  

**Key question:**  
**"Did I trade the plan I wrote down?"**

---

### **2. State vs Outcome**

Connects your internal state with your results.

TradeMonkey records:

- Entry emotions  
- Exit emotions  
- Conviction changes from entry to exit  
- Stress patterns around volatility or uncertainty  

**Key question:**  
**"What mental states consistently help or hurt my performance?"**

---

### **3. Rules vs Reality**

Tracks whether you follow the boundaries you set for yourself.

Examples:

- Max daily loss  
- Max trades per day  
- Session-only trading  
- No trading around high-impact news  
- Position size limits  

TradeMonkey checks every trade against your rules and exposes violations objectively.

**Key question:**  
**"Am I respecting the guardrails I said I would?"**

---

## Why TradeMonkey Must Be Used *During* Trading

Traditional journaling happens **after the session**, when memory, emotions, and narratives change the truth.

TradeMonkey works differently.

It is designed to be used **alongside your trading**, not afterward. This ensures the data reflects what was *actually happening in the moment*, not a reconstruction of it.

Real-time usage allows TradeMonkey to:

- Capture emotions without hindsight distortion  
- Track conviction before outcome influences perception  
- Measure plan adherence accurately  
- Detect rule violations as they happen  
- Produce clean psychological and execution patterns  
- Provide objective, actionable insights  

If you wait until after the trade, the mirror becomes blurred.

**TradeMonkey is an instrument panel, not a diary.  
Instruments must be read during the flight, not after landing.**

## Your First 15 Minutes

You do not need to configure everything immediately.  
A few simple steps will produce your first insight.

---

### 1. Create a Trading Account

Create one account for each real account you trade:

- Challenge accounts  
- Funded accounts  
- Personal accounts  
- Futures / Forex / Crypto accounts  

This keeps analytics, risk limits, and rules isolated per account.

---

### 2. Bring in Trades (The Foundation for All Insights)

You can:

- **Import a CSV**, which instantly populates your history, or  
- **Manually log a few trades**, if you prefer to start small  
- **Simply copy and paste an image** of your trade entry, take profit, & stoploss.

Even 10–20 trades are enough for the mirror to begin reflecting patterns.

TradeMonkey will automatically:

- Detect orphans (missing manual entries)  
- Reconcile plan vs actual  
- Tag rule violations  
- Build early psychological baselines  

---

### 3. Add Reflections When You Close Trades

Reflections are captured **at the moment of decision**, not afterward.

For each closed trade, record:

- Entry emotions  
- Exit emotions  
- Conviction score  
- Whether you followed your plan  

These data points feed:

- State vs Outcome analytics  
- Conviction drop patterns  
- AI Diagnostics  
- AI Deep Dive Explorer  
- Execution Recap summaries  

Accurate reflections = accurate insights.

---

### 4. Keep TradeMonkey Open While You Trade

This unlocks TradeMonkey's full value:

- Real-time rule checking  
- Accurate risk comparisons  
- Clean emotional data  
- Live adherence tracking  
- Immediate violation detection  
- More truthful patterns  

Think of TradeMonkey as a **live mental dashboard** sitting beside your charts.

---

### 5. Review Your Execution Recap (Your First A-Ha Moment)

Once you have a few trades and reflections, open **Execution Recap** to see:

- Entry vs exit screenshots (if uploaded)  
- Plan vs execution alignment  
- Changes in conviction  
- Emotional patterns  
- Rule violations  
- Notes or breakdowns per trade  

This is where most traders notice the first clear pattern in their behavior.

Examples:

- "My conviction collapses mid-trade during consolidations."  
- "I risk more when frustrated."  
- "My afternoon trades violate my session rule consistently."  

Execution Recap makes discrepancies visual, objective, and impossible to ignore.

---

## What to Do Next

Once your first trades are logged:

1. Add 1–2 basic rules (e.g., max daily loss, max trades per day).  
2. Explore **Time-Scoped Analytics** ("Last 20 trades" reveals recent progress).  
3. Review **AI Diagnostics** when they appear.  
4. Begin checking your trades against your rules daily.  

This gradual approach builds the cleanest execution dataset possible.

---

## If Something Seems Off

Common steps:

- Ensure you selected the correct account  
- Confirm your timezone and session rules  
- Check the CSV import guide if numbers don't line up  
- Ensure reflections are being added to closed trades  

TradeMonkey will guide you as more data becomes available.
