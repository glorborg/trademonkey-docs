# Reflections (Behavioral Record)

## Purpose

Reflections are timestamped behavioral snapshots.

They capture your execution state, intent, and observed behavior at specific moments so TradeMonkey can analyze what actually happened, not what you later remember.

Reflections turn subjective experience into structured evidence that can be replayed, compared, and analyzed across time.

They are not a diary.  
They are behavioral records.

## What a Reflection Captures

A reflection can be trade-linked or free-form.  
In both cases, it captures what you observed about your behavior, not commentary or self-judgment.

## Trade-Linked Reflections

When attached to a trade, reflections typically capture:

Emotional State  
One or more labels (e.g. Calm, Confident, Fear, FOMO, Frustration)

Conviction (1–10)  
How strong the setup or decision felt at that moment

Plan Adherence  
Whether execution followed your plan (Yes / Partial / No)

Notes  
A brief, factual description of what you saw and did

Tags (optional)  
Context such as setup, session, or strategy  
(e.g. London open, breakout, scalp)

Trade-linked reflections appear:

Inside the Trade Thread (timeline evidence)

In Behavioral Recap (condensed replay)

In Drift Detection and analytics (pattern aggregation)

## Free-Form Reflections (State Snapshots)

You can also create reflections not attached to a trade.

These are used to capture execution state or observations outside of a specific position, such as:

Pre-session plans or expectations

Post-session reviews

Days you chose not to trade

Noticing emerging behavioral patterns

Mental state during drawdowns or recovery periods

These reflections live in the Behavioral Record and can still be used in higher-level analysis.

## When Reflections Are Recorded

### At Entry (Trade-Linked)

Capture:

Entry emotions

Entry conviction

Entry plan adherence

Brief note explaining the decision

This records intent at the moment of commitment.

### At Exit (Trade-Linked)

Capture:

Exit emotions

Exit conviction

Exit plan adherence

Exit reason (target, stop, discretionary, etc.)

Brief note

This records decision quality under resolution.

### After the Trade (Optional)

In the Trade Thread, you may add a reflection to capture:

What held

What drifted

What you noticed about your execution

Later reflections never overwrite earlier ones — they sit alongside them with their own timestamps.

### On Non-Trading Days

Create a reflection to record:

Emotional state

Why you did or did not trade

Observations about discipline, patience, or impulse control

These snapshots help explain absence of trades, which is often as important as presence.

## How Reflection Data Is Used

When reflections are logged consistently, TradeMonkey can surface:

Behavioral Performance Patterns

Results by emotional state  
(e.g. Calm vs FOMO entries)

Conviction patterns  
(e.g. low-conviction entries vs outcomes)

Conviction decay  
Where confidence collapses between entry and exit

Execution Drift Signals

Performance when plan adherence is Yes vs Partial vs No

Clustering of rule violations by emotion, session, or setup

Behavioral precursors to poor exits or early closes

AI-Assisted Summaries (Optional)

When you choose to use AI:

Reflections provide the behavioral signal

AI summarizes patterns instead of repeating raw stats

Without reflections, analytics are limited to price and P&L only.

## What Makes a Good Reflection

Good reflections are:

Structured  
Emotions, conviction, and adherence are selected explicitly

Specific  
Reference concrete context (session, setup, rule interaction)

Factual  
Describe what happened, not how you judge yourself

Example (Entry)

Emotions: Calm, Confident

Conviction: 8/10

Plan Adherence: Yes

Notes: "Waited for pullback to support, three confluences present, entered 10 minutes after London open as planned."

Avoid vague venting like:

"Felt bad, market was stupid, I'm undisciplined."

That produces no usable signal.

## Best Practices

Log close to the decision  
Accuracy drops the longer you wait.

Be honest, not flattering  
Record how it was, not how you wish it had been.

Be consistent, not exhaustive  
A small set logged every time beats long notes logged occasionally.

Use depth selectively  
More detail for emotional trades or rule breaks; lighter entries for routine trades.

## Important Notes

Reflections are optional, but powerful.  
Core trade tracking works without them; behavioral insight does not.

Reflections are descriptive, not prescriptive.  
They document behavior. Interpretation and correction remain yours.

Imported trades contain financial data only.  
You can add reflections later to include those trades in behavioral analysis.
